This technique employs machine learning models, often called encoders, to transform text, audio, images, or other types of data into high-dimensional vectors. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the data, which can then be searched through to find similar content based on vectors being "near" one another in a high-dimensional space. This can be a great compliment to traditional keyword-based search techniques but is also seeing an explosion of excitement because of its relevance to augment the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by providing ground truth outside of what the LLMs "know." In search use cases, this allows you to find relevant results even when the exact wording isn\'t known.
