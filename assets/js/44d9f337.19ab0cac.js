The colored boxes represent instructions independent of each other.\nTwo-way branching is usually implemented with a ",(0,t.jsx)(i.a,{href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_(computer_science)",children:"conditional jump"}),' instruction. A conditional jump can either be "not taken" and continue execution with the first branch of code which follows immediately after the conditional jump, or it can be "taken" and jump to a different place in program memory where the second branch of code is stored. It is not known for certain whether a conditional jump will be taken or not taken until the condition has been calculated and the conditional jump has passed the execution stage in the instruction pipeline (see fig. 1).\nWithout branch prediction, the processor would have to wait until the conditional jump instruction has passed the execute stage before the next instruction can enter the fetch stage in the pipeline. The branch predictor attempts to avoid this waste of time by trying to guess whether the conditional jump is most likely to be taken or not taken.

As a result, making a pipeline longer increases the need for a more advanced branch predictor.\nThe first time a conditional jump instruction is encountered, there is not much information to base a prediction on. But the branch predictor keeps records of whether branches are taken or not taken. When it encounters a conditional jump that has been seen several times before then it can base the prediction on the history. The branch predictor may, for example, recognize that the conditional jump is taken more often than not, or that it is taken every second time.\nBranch prediction is not the same as ",(0,t.jsx)(i.a,{href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_target_predictor",children:"branch target prediction"}),".
