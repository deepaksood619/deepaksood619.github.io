For example, string columns will be dictionary encoded, LZF compressed, and have search indexes created for faster filtering. Numeric columns will have completely different compression and encoding algorithms applied. Druid segments are immutable once finalized, so updates in Druid have limitations. Although more recent versions of Druid have added "lookups", or the ability to join a mutable table external to Druid with an immutable one in Druid, I would not recommend Druid for any workflows where the same underlying data is frequently updated and those updates need to complete in less than a second (say, powering a social media profile page).
