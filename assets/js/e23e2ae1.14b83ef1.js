Knowing you have a competitive advantage is often the enemy of beginner\'s mind, because doing well reduces the incentive to explore other ideas, especially when those ideas conflict with your proven strategy.

"I\'m going to work out every day" is better than "I\'m going to lose 10 pounds" because once you lose 10 pounds you\'ll probably stop working out.
