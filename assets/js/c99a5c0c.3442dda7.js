This actually takes advantage of the fact that many drives can move the read/write head at high speeds if it's moving across a large number of tracks (e.g. the seek time from the last track to track 0 is smaller than one would expect and usually considerably less than the time it would take to seek there one track at a time).The huge jump from one end request to the other is not considered as a head movement as the cylinders are treated as a circular list."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(i.h3,{id:"n-look-and-f-look",children:"N-LOOK and F-LOOK"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(i.p,{children:"N and F LOOK were designed to offset LOOK's bias towards recent jobs.

To explain these algorithms we're going to use the example of a disk with 200 tracks, and the read/write head starts at track 100. The request queue, in order, contains requests for tracks: 55, 58, 18, 90, 160, 38, we assume that the request queue is split into two, with the oldest one containing the requests for tracks: 55, 58, 18, 90.
