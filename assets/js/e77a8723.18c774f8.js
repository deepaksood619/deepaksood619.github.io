This is in contrast to a general-purpose language (GPL), which is broadly applicable across domains. There are a wide variety of DSLs, ranging from widely used languages for common domains, such as HTML for web pages, down to languages used by only one or a few pieces of software, such as MUSH soft code. DSLs can be further subdivided by the kind of language, and include domain-specific markup languages, domain-specific modeling languages (more generally, specification languages), and domain-specific programming languages. Special-purpose computer languages have always existed in the computer age, but the term "domain-specific language" has become more popular due to the rise of domain-specific modeling. Simpler DSLs, particularly ones used by a single application, are sometimes informally called mini-languages.'}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(a.p,{children:(0,s.jsx)(a.a,{href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language",children:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language"})}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(a.h2,{id:"channels",children:"Channels"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(a.p,{children:"Channels are data-race safe communication primitives.
