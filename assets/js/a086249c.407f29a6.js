Realtime Node"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Real-time nodes encapsulate the functionality to ingest and query event streams. Events indexed via these nodes are immediately available for querying. The nodes are only concerned with events for some small time range and periodically hand off immutable batches of events they have collected over this small time range to other nodes in the Druid cluster that are specialized in dealing with batches of immutable events.

These indexes are incrementally populated as events are ingested and the indexes are also directly queryable. Druid be- haves as a row store for queries on events that exist in this JVM heap-based buffer. To avoid heap overflow problems, real-time nodes persist their in-memory indexes to disk either periodically or after some maximum row limit is reached. This persist process converts data stored in the in-memory buffer to a column oriented storage format described in Section 4. Each persisted index is im- mutable and real-time nodes load persisted indexes into off-heap memory such that they can still be queried. This process is de- scribed in detail in and is illustrated in Figure 2."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:'On a periodic basis, each real-time node will schedule a back- ground task that searches for all locally persisted indexes. The task merges these indexes together and builds an immutable block of data that contains all the events that have been ingested by a real- time node for some span of time. We refer to this block of data as a "segment". During the handoff stage, a real-time node uploads this segment to a permanent backup storage, typically a distributed file system such as S3 or HDFS, which Druid refers to as "deep storage".

In many real-world workflows, most of the data loaded in a Druid cluster is immutable and hence, historical nodes are typically the main workers of a Druid cluster.

Instructions to load and drop segments are sent over Zookeeper and contain information about where the segment is located in deep storage and how to decompress and process the segment. Before a historical node downloads a particular segment from deep storage, it first checks a local cache that maintains information about what segments already exist on the node. If information about a segment is not present in the cache, the historical node will proceed to download the segment from deep storage. Once processing is complete, the segment is announced in Zookeeper. At this point, the segment is queryable. The local cache also allows for historical nodes to be quickly updated and restarted. On startup, the node examines its cache and immediately serves whatever data it finds. Historical nodes can support read consistency because they only deal with immutable data. Immutable data blocks also enable a simple parallelization model: historical nodes can concurrently scan and aggregate immutable blocks without blocking."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.h4,{id:"tiers",children:"Tiers"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Historical nodes can be grouped in different tiers, where all nodes in a given tier are identically configured.

The purpose of tiered nodes is to enable higher or lower priority segments to be dis- tributed according to their importance. For example, it is possible to spin up a "hot" tier of historical nodes that have a high num- ber of cores and large memory capacity. The "hot" cluster can be configured to download more frequently accessed data. A parallel "cold" cluster can also be created with much less powerful backing hardware.

Coordinator nodes also maintain a connection to a MySQL database that contains additional operational parameters and configurations. One of the key pieces of information located in the MySQL database is a table that contains a list of all segments that should be served by historical nodes.
