This is a contradiction because we can\u2019t achieve prosperity in the modern sense other than through greed and ill actions. We base our entire theory of economics on contradictions like this.

Our understanding of the value of education depends on our social class. For example, the poor place little value on it, whereas the rich see it as an opportunity to network. Education is limited and problem solving-based, as opposed to teaching us wisdom and the ability to think deeply. All we do is apply pre-existing ideas, prejudices, and background theories to a situation, instead of truly thinking for ourselves.'}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:'"The Third World," considers the fatal flaw in "solving" problems in developing countries. Our charity comes from the grave assumption that our way is the only way to build an economy. Distributing mass amounts of aid and assistance to countries in need doesn\u2019t empower them to build a structure that suits them; it merely glosses over the real problems\u2014no effort is put into supporting rural communities, which make up most of their population. Instead, there\u2019s an expectation that industrializing their nation will effectively absorb them all into cities.'}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Schumacher takes us through this argument step-by-step. If rural workers have little to no employment, they move into urban areas. This creates a mass shift in population to an area that can\u2019t sustain them all.

Our entire philosophy is causing the problem to only get worse.'}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:'The final section, "Organization and Ownership," discusses why socialist theory doesn\u2019t go far enough, and how we urgently must find alternatives to capitalism. The problem comes down to our own natures\u2014we are greedy and envious and stop at nothing to ensure our materialistic growth. Our desires are at odds with our finite natural environment.
