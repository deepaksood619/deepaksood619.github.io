Next, the client sends a PUBLISH message with the payload "Online" and the retained flag set to true to the same topic (client1/status). As long as client1 stays connected, newly-subscribed clients to the client1/status topic receive the "Online" retained message. If client1 disconnects unexpectedly, the broker publishes the LWT message with the payload "Offline" as the new retained message.
