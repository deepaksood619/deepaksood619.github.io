Once minimised, canonical sum-of-products and product-of-sums expressions can be implemented directly using AND and OR logic operators.Diagrammatic and mechanical methods for minimizing simple logic expressions have existed since at least the medieval times. More systematic methods for minimizing complex expressions began to be developed in the early 1950s, but until the mid to late 1980s the Karnaugh map was the most common used in practice.\nIn many digital circuits and practical problems we need to find expression with minimum variables. We can minimize Boolean expressions of 3, 4 variables very easily using K-map without using any Boolean algebra theorems. K-map can take two forms Sum of Product (SOP) and Product of Sum (POS) according to the need of problem. K-map is table like representation but it gives more information than TRUTH TABLE.
