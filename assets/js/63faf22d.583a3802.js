This has the marked disadvantage of making the compiled binary very large if uses a lot of static memory. It's possible to write a multi-gigabytes binary generated from less than half a dozen lines of code. Another option is for the compiler to inject initialisation code that will allocate memory in some other way before the program is executed. This code will vary according to the target platform and OS. In practice, modern compilers use heuristics to decide which of these options to use. You can try this out yourself by writing a small C program that allocates a large static array of either 10k, 1m, 10m, 100m, 1G or 10G items. For many compilers, the binary size will keep growing linearly with the size of the array, and past a certain point, it will shrink again as the compiler uses another allocation strategy."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"register-memory",children:"Register Memory"}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["The last memory class are 'register' variables.
