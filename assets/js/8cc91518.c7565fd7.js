They\u2019re both easier to use and more secure than passwords, so users no longer need to rely on the names of pets, birthdays or the infamous "password123." Instead, passkeys let users sign in to apps and sites the same way they unlock their devices: with a fingerprint, a face scan or a screen lock PIN. And, unlike passwords, passkeys are resistant to online attacks like phishing, making them more secure than things like SMS one-time codes.']}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Passkeys are easier:"}),"\n",(0,n.jsxs)(t.ul,{children:["\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.li,{children:"Users can select an account to sign in with.
