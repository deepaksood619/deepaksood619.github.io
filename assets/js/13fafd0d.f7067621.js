So, in essence, Transformations take an RDD as an input and perform some function on them based on what Transformation is being called, and outputs one or more RDDs.

The following is just as much as you\'ll need to know in order to have a working understanding of what certain snippets of Spark code do. In Spark, when an item of processing has to be done, there is a "driver" process that is in charge of taking the user\'s code and converting it into a set of multiple tasks. There are also "executor" processes, each operating on a separate node in the cluster, that are in charge of running the tasks, as delegated by the driver. Each driver process has a set of executors that it has access to in order to run tasks. A Spark ',(0,s.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"application"})," is a user built program that consists of a driver and that driver's associated executors. A Spark ",(0,s.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"job"})," is task or set of tasks to be executed with executor processes, as directed by the driver. A job is triggered by the calling of an RDD Action. This stuff can be rather confusing, so don't sweat it if it doesn't make total sense at first, it's just helpful to be familiar with these terms when they are implemented in code later on."]})]})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,n.a)(),...e.components};return t?(0,s.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,s.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}},152850:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{Z:()=>s});const s=a.p+"assets/images/Technologies-Apache-Terms-image1-4ce5928ec10ec693a7911c25f61a2354.jpg"},511151:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{Z:()=>i,a:()=>r});var s=a(667294);const n={},o=s.createContext(n);function r(e){const t=s.useContext(o);return s.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function i(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(n):e.components||n:r(e.components),s.createElement(o.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
