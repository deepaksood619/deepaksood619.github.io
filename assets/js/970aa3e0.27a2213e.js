Like two neural network. First is generator, it will generate new data, and other is discriminator, it will check if the new data is valid. These two battle with each other and get good at both sides. Generator will become better in create fake inputs, and disciminator will become good in recognizing fake inputs."]}),"\n"]}),"\n"]}),"\n"]})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:i}={...(0,t.R)(),...e.components};return i?(0,r.jsx)(i,{...e,children:(0,r.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},406326:(e,i,n)=>{n.d(i,{A:()=>s});const s=n.p+"assets/images/ML-Classification-image1-ce85c286ca309cef7e1e6ddc6ceb45a5.jpg"},499054:(e,i,n)=>{n.d(i,{A:()=>s});const s=n.p+"assets/images/ML-Classification-image2-e90dbf0910265b206e00d1c3524c70e9.jpg"},598628:(e,i,n)=>{n.d(i,{A:()=>s});const s=n.p+"assets/images/ML-Classification-image3-b19fc3eae689aaa4a720746ae87b45d5.jpg"},323567:(e,i,n)=>{n.d(i,{A:()=>s});const s=n.p+"assets/images/ML-Classification-image4-bb140a554ecfb0bfa748d375ed5cfa12.jpg"},151186:(e,i,n)=>{n.d(i,{A:()=>s});const s=n.p+"assets/images/ML-Classification-image5-1a91153ce8087c31edea20aae3c05a2a.jpg"},661085:(e,i,n)=>{n.d(i,{A:()=>s});const s=n.p+"assets/images/ML-Classification-image6-dc8e64577459ffaae5355032ad4b38f6.jpg"},209952:(e,i,n)=>{n.d(i,{A:()=>s});const s=n.p+"assets/images/ML-Classification-image7-c6ae1e4cfd279965a9dd3e71f31babfb.jpg"},634651:(e,i,n)=>{n.d(i,{A:()=>s});const s=n.p+"assets/images/ML-Classification-image8-e65fb50b62895aead0e6b4c2ad527a4d.jpg"},186814:(e,i,n)=>{n.d(i,{A:()=>s});const s=n.p+"assets/images/ML-Classification-image9-09c5ba60b4d907db9375046c5d94620c.jpg"},28453:(e,i,n)=>{n.d(i,{R:()=>a,x:()=>l});var s=n(296540);const r={},t=s.createContext(r);function a(e){const i=s.useContext(t);return s.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(i):{...i,...e}}),[i,e])}function l(e){let i;return i=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(r):e.components||r:a(e.components),s.createElement(t.Provider,{value:i},e.children)}}}]);
