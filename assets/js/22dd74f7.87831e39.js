The capacitor can either be charged or discharged; these two states are taken to represent the two values of a bit, conventionally called 0 and 1. The electric charge on the capacitors slowly leaks off, so without intervention the data on the chip would soon be lost. To prevent this, DRAM requires an external memory refresh circuit which periodically rewrites the data in the capacitors, restoring them to their original charge. This refresh process is the defining characteristic of dynamic random-access memory, in contrast to static random-access memory(SRAM) which does not require data to be refreshed. Unlike flash memory, DRAM is volatile memory(vs.non-volatile memory), since it loses its data quickly when power is removed.

Because GTID-based replication is completely transaction-based, it is simple to determine whether sources and replicas are consistent; as long as all transactions committed on a source are also committed on a replica, consistency between the two is guaranteed.

In the client-sever model, a client communicates directly with an endpoint.The pub/sub model decouples the client that sends a message (the publisher) from the client or clients that receive the messages (the subscribers). The publishers and subscribers never contact each other directly. In fact, they are not even aware that the other exists. The connection between them is handled by a third component (the broker). The job of the broker is to filter all incoming messages and distribute them correctly to subscribers.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"networking/mqtt/qos-levels":{"id":"networking/mqtt/qos-levels","title":"QoS Levels","description":"What is Quality of Service?","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"networking/mqtt/readme":{"id":"networking/mqtt/readme","title":"MQTT","description":"- Intro","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"networking/mqtt/retained-messages":{"id":"networking/mqtt/retained-messages","title":"Retained Messages","description":"In MQTT, the client that publishes a message has no guarantee that a subscribing client actually receives the message. The publishing client can only make sure that the message gets delivered safely to the broker. Basically, the same is true for a subscribing client. The client that connects and subscribes to topics has no guarantee on when the publishing client will publish a message in one of their topics of interest. It can take a few seconds, minutes, or hours for the publisher to send a new message in one of the subscribed topics. Until the next message is published, the subscribing client is totally in the dark about the current status of the topic. This situation is where retained messages come into play.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"networking/mqtt/scaling":{"id":"networking/mqtt/scaling","title":"Scaling","description":"In a brokered architecture it\'s critical to avoid a single point of failure and to think about scaling out, since typically only one broker node is used.
