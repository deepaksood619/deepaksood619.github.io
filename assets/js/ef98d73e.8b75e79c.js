Actually, this is also where GNN initially gets started. If some of you have experience in NLP, you must be thinking that text should be a type of sequential or temporal data which can be best described by an RNN or an LTSM. Well, GNN approaches the problem from a completely different angle. GNN utilized the inner relations of words or documents to predict the categories. For example, the citation network is trying to predict the label of each paper in the network given by the paper citation relationship and the words that are cited in other papers.

In short, ZSL is trying to learn to classify a class givenNOtraining samples (of the target classes) at all. It was quite challenging because if no training samples were given, we need to let the model "think" logically to recognize a target. For example, if we were given three images (as shown in the figure below) and told to find "okapi" among them. We may not have seen an "okapi" before. But if we were also given the information that an "okapi" is a deer-face animal with four legs and has zebra-striped skin, then it is not hard for us to figure out which one is "okapi". Typical methods are simulating this "thinking process" by converting the detected features into text. However, text encodings are independent among each other. It is hard to model the relationships between the text descriptions. In other hard, graph representations well model these relationships, making the machine to think in a more "human-like" manner.']}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.h3,{id:"gnn-in-other-domains",children:"GNN in Other Domains"}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.p,{children:["More practical applications of GNN include ",(0,a.jsx)(n.em,{children:"human behavior detection, traffic control, molecular structure study, recommender system, program verification, logical reasoning, social influence prediction, and adversarial attack prevention."})," Below shows a graph that models the relationships of people in a social network.
