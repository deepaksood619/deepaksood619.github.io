Amazon ECR hosts your images in a highly available and scalable architecture, allowing you to reliably deploy containers for your applications. Integration with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) provides resource-level control of each repository. With Amazon ECR, there are no upfront fees or commitments. You pay only for the amount of data you store in your repositories and data transferred to the Internet."]}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(a.p,{children:(0,n.jsx)(a.a,{href:"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/pull-through-cache.html",children:"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/pull-through-cache.html"})}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(a.h2,{id:"links",children:"Links"}),"\n",(0,n.jsxs)(a.ul,{children:["\n",(0,n.jsx)(a.li,{children:(0,n.jsx)(a.a,{href:"/cloud/aws/compute/aws-database-migration-service-dms",children:"aws-database-migration-service-dms"})}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(a.li,{children:(0,n.jsx)(a.a,{href:"/cloud/aws/compute/aws-database-migration-service-dms",children:"AWS Data Sync - aws-database-migration-service-dms"})}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(a.li,{children:(0,n.jsx)(a.a,{href:"/cloud/aws/compute/aws-database-migration-service-dms",children:"AWS Transfer Family - aws-database-migration-service-dms"})}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(a.p,{children:(0,n.jsx)(a.a,{href:"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/cloud-storage-options/",children:"Cloud Storage Options - Block Storage vs File Storage vs Object Storage Explained"})}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(a.p,{children:(0,n.jsx)(a.img,{alt:"cloud-storage-options",src:t(567534).A+"",width:"999",height:"608"})})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:a}={...(0,i.R)(),...e.components};return a?(0,n.jsx)(a,{...e,children:(0,n.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},340471:(e,a,t)=>{t.d(a,{A:()=>s});const s=t.p+"assets/images/Cloud-AWS-Storage-image1-e9617a88ffb5c86a796301f112ca1ad0.jpg"},929544:(e,a,t)=>{t.d(a,{A:()=>s});const s=t.p+"assets/images/Cloud-AWS-Storage-image2-b7517a0959bd9fa5ff847cea7999889d.jpg"},57157:(e,a,t)=>{t.d(a,{A:()=>s});const s=t.p+"assets/images/Cloud-AWS-Storage-image3-9479096028845940c98372344b2705dc.jpg"},9822:(e,a,t)=>{t.d(a,{A:()=>s});const s=t.p+"assets/images/Cloud-AWS-Storage-image4-435d1fb52440278537c58afa46fcc20c.jpg"},567534:(e,a,t)=>{t.d(a,{A:()=>s});const s=t.p+"assets/images/Pasted image 20230802182140-349ca064bce6a234a0a11798ca8e4e8d.jpg"},934327:(e,a,t)=>{t.d(a,{A:()=>s});const s=t.p+"assets/images/Pasted image 20250912004236-0d3a0601ea48a8e827dcab816398d367.png"},28453:(e,a,t)=>{t.d(a,{R:()=>o,x:()=>r});var s=t(296540);const n={},i=s.createContext(n);function o(e){const a=s.useContext(i);return s.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(a):{...a,...e}}),[a,e])}function r(e){let a;return a=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(n):e.components||n:o(e.components),s.createElement(i.Provider,{value:a},e.children)}}}]);
