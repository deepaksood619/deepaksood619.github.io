You define a set of recommended and supported development paths to production and incrementally \"pave\" a way through them with an internal platform. To use a real-world analogy, new paths often start out as dirt trails, but as more people use them, they're paved to improve safety while maintaining velocity and throughput. Paved paths within an internal developer platform have similar goals. They're designed to guide developers through critical requirements and standards without sacrificing developer delivery velocity. This is achieved by providing dev teams with standardized, secure, and scalable self-service capabilities. At the same time, you still make it easy for operations and your IT organization to ensure that the underlying infrastructure and tools are efficient, compliant, and cost-effective. While some paths might be partially paved, a fully paved, golden path reduces cognitive load for everyone involved. Developers are the primary consumers or customer of an internal developer platform. Automation and centralization enable efficient operations while still ensuring stakeholder requirements like compliance are met."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(n.h2,{id:"links",children:"Links"}),"\n",(0,r.jsxs)(n.ul,{children:["\n",(0,r.jsx)(n.li,{children:(0,r.jsx)(n.a,{href:"/devops/others/backstage",children:"Backstage"})}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(n.li,{children:(0,r.jsx)(n.a,{href:"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/platform-engineering/what-is-platform-engineering",children:"What is platform engineering? | Microsoft Learn"})}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(n.li,{children:(0,r.jsx)(n.a,{href:"https://platformengineering.org/blog/what-is-platform-engineering",children:"What is platform engineering?"})}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(n.li,{children:(0,r.jsx)(n.a,{href:"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGVPcLSzJXQos1O18dvKoW2XSczz2I2lH",children:"Platform Engineering Series - YouTube"})}),"\n",(0,r.jsxs)(n.li,{children:[(0,r.jsx)(n.a,{href:"https://www.cortex.io/",children:"Cortex | Internal Developer Portal"}),"\n",(0,r.jsxs)(n.ul,{children:["\n",(0,r.jsx)(n.li,{children:(0,r.jsx)(n.a,{href:"https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/cortex",children:"Cortex: Cortex is the Internal Developer Portal eliminating \u201cdeveloper tax\u201d\u2026 | Y Combinator"})}),"\n"]}),"\n"]}),"\n"]})]})}function c(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,o.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,r.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,r.jsx)(p,{...e})}):p(e)}},28453:(e,n,t)=>{t.d(n,{R:()=>a,x:()=>s});var i=t(296540);const r={},o=i.createContext(r);function a(e){const n=i.useContext(o);return i.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(n):{...n,...e}}),[n,e])}function s(e){let n;return n=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(r):e.components||r:a(e.components),i.createElement(o.Provider,{value:n},e.children)}}}]);
