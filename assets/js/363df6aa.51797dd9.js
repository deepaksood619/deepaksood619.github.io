The main goal of this project is to provide simple and robust facilities for loadbalancing and high-availability to Linux system and Linux based infrastructures.

Keepalived implements a set of checkers to dynamically and adaptively maintain and manage loadbalanced server pool according their health. On the other hand high-availability is achieved by VRRPprotocol. VRRP is a fundamental brick for router failover. In addition, Keepalived implements a set of hooks to the VRRP finite state machine providing low-level and high-speed protocol interactions. Keepalived frameworks can be used independently or all together to provide resilient infrastructures."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(o.p,{children:(0,a.jsx)(o.a,{href:"https://www.keepalived.org/",children:"https://www.keepalived.org"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(o.h2,{id:"envoy-proxy",children:"Envoy Proxy"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(o.p,{children:"Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(o.p,{children:'Originally built atLyft, Envoy is a high performance C++ distributed proxy designed for single services and applications, as well as a communication bus and "universal data plane" designed for large microservice "service mesh" architectures.
