However, human moderators alone cannot scale to meet these needs at sufficient quality or speed, which leads to a poor user experience, high costs to achieve scale, or even a loss of brand reputation. By using Rekognition for image and video moderation, human moderators can review a much smaller set of content, typically 1-5% of the total volume, already flagged by machine learning. This enables them to focus on more valuable activities and still achieve comprehensive moderation coverage at a fraction of their existing cost.
