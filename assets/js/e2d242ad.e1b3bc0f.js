S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval delivers the fastest access to archive storage, with the same throughput and milliseconds access as the S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA storage classes. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval is ideal for archive data that needs immediate access, such as medical images, news media assets, or user-generated content archives. You can upload objects directly to S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, or use S3 Lifecycle policies to transfer data from the S3 storage classes.
