I want to write about my thoughts on the book, what I took away from it, and more. First, while this book doesn\u2019t directly address climate change, it talks about a very common theme that I\'ve read about in previous books. The idea is that climate change is not a personal problem but a structural one caused by how we view and measure the economy and what we consider success. As such, I believe this book is a must-read for those who want to better understand the "How we got here" part of the climate crisis. From this point, Raworth explains a crucial point \u2013 we must create a new system that is so good that the old system becomes obsolete.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Secondly, we should stop looking at the war on climate as just climate change. Instead, we should be labeling it as planetary boundaries. Climate instability is just one of the many boundaries that humanity has crossed in moving towards our modern age.
