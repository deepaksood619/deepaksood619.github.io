Buddhism has a concept called beginner\'s mind, which is an active openness to trying new things and studying new ideas, unburdened by past preconceptions, like a beginner would. Knowing you have a competitive advantage is often the enemy of beginner\'s mind, because doing well reduces the incentive to explore other ideas, especially when those ideas conflict with your proven strategy.

"I\'m going to work out every day" is better than "I\'m going to lose 10 pounds" because once you lose 10 pounds you\'ll probably stop working out. Same thing happens when a successful business or career hits a big goal. Paranoia is a trait newcomers use to combat how deeply the odds are stacked against them. But it tends to die once a goal is hit. Few things sap the paranoiac drive to do better than stable cash flow and high profit margins.
