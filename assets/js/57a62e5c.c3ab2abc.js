That's the kind of management team we want as investors. Someone who is not going to hide problems but will tell it upfront together with the possible damage and the potential solutions that can mitigate or overcome these problems.

And it is no surprise that the top companies in the 2022 version which included NVIDIA, Hubspot, Box.com, Google etc. have also been amongst the top performing stocks in the last 5 years.
