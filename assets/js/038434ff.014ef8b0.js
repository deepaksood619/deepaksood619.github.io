It then calculates results over and over, each time using a different set of random values from the probability functions. Depending upon the number of uncertainties and the ranges specified for them, a Monte Carlo simulation could involve thousands or tens of thousands of recalculations before it is complete. Monte Carlo simulation produces distributions of possible outcome values.\nBy using probability distributions, variables can have different probabilities of different outcomes occurring. Probability distributions are a much more realistic way of describing uncertainty in variables of a risk analysis.\nCommon probability distributions include:"}),"\n",(0,s.jsxs)(t.ul,{children:["\n",(0,s.jsxs)(t.li,{children:[(0,s.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"Normal (Bell curve)"}),"\nThe user simply defines the mean or expected value and a standard deviation to describe the variation about the mean.

Each set of samples is called an iteration, and the resulting outcome from that sample is recorded. Monte Carlo simulation does this hundreds or thousands of times, and the result is a probability distribution of possible outcomes.
