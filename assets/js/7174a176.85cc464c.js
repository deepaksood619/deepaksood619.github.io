By using Rekognition for image and video moderation, human moderators can review a much smaller set of content, typically 1-5% of the total volume, already flagged by machine learning.

For example, you can use a vocabulary filter to automatically remove profane words from the transcription results for content moderation or generating family-friendly captions.
