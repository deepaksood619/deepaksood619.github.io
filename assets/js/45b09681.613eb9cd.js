Both protocols rely on intermediate queuing/store-and-forward techniques to reduce or eliminate message loss in case a client loses the connection to the broker. The main conceptual difference is that in MQTT one client (identified by a 'unique' client id), has one TCP connection to the broker and only a single \"queue\". As a consequence, even if a client has multiple subscriptions all messages end up in the same queue. In contrast, with AMQP a queue is a resource on the broker and is decoupled from the client, multiple clients can consume the same queue e.g. for load balancing purposes. So a client can create many queues and decide if and when to consume messages. Moreover, a AMQP connection, which is just a TCP connection, is multiplexed via logical channels, enabling the development of highly performant consumers and publishers."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(s.h2,{id:"links",children:"Links"}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)(s.ul,{children:["\n",(0,i.jsx)(s.li,{children:(0,i.jsx)(s.a,{href:"/computer-science/system-design/message-oriented-architecture-mom",children:"Message Oriented Architecture (MOM)"})}),"\n"]})]})}function m(e={}){const{wrapper:s}={...(0,a.R)(),...e.components};return s?(0,i.jsx)(s,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},28453:(e,s,n)=>{n.d(s,{R:()=>o,x:()=>r});var t=n(296540);const i={},a=t.createContext(i);function o(e){const s=t.useContext(a);return t.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(s):{...s,...e}}),[s,e])}function r(e){let s;return s=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(i):e.components||i:o(e.components),t.createElement(a.Provider,{value:s},e.children)}}}]);
