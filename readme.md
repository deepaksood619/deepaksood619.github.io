## Getting started

This garden is quite literally my digital brain. It includes my thoughts, notes and links on topics I care about.

I update the notes daily in my [github repo](https://github.com/deepaksood619/deepaksood619.github.io/), and build it few times in a month using Github Actions and Gatsby.

The content being markdown files, which after every commit to the builds the website using docusaurus and publishes it to [deepaksood619.github.io](https://deepaksood619.github.io/) from which you are likely reading this page.

The way I structure each page often looks the same and follows a structure. The sidebar you see on the left is sorted alphabetically. It's nested too. Many top level folders are nested quite deep.

I use Zettlekasten Method for note taking and obsidian tool to manage and structure my notes. I have previously used Onenote but grown out of it in about 4 years, since it doesn't scale in terms of number of notes and doesn't have linking of notes

## Must Read Pages

There's 2000+ pages in here and lots of them I think are interesting. But these few can be nice starts for a read:
d

- [Quotes](https://deepaksood619.github.io/knowledge/quotes-proverbs/) small phrases that makes my day and help me to remember and revise simple rules in a fun way
- [Mental Models](https://deepaksood619.github.io/knowledge/general/mental-models) that I have compiled over the years and helps me learn concepts quickly of any domain and connect concepts across domains
- [Learning how to learn](https://deepaksood619.github.io/psychology/learning/learning-intro) course that changed my learning approach and in turn my whole life, and the reason why I write and maintain these notes.
- [Book - Principles by Ray Dalio](https://deepaksood619.github.io/book-summaries/principles)
- [Fallacies of Distributed Computing](https://deepaksood619.github.io/computer-science/distributed-system/fallacies-and-problems) and [Biases / Fallacies](https://deepaksood619.github.io/psychology/biases-fallacies) of Human Computing, which everyone should know and try to overcome in their lifetimes
- [Types of Databases](https://deepaksood619.github.io/databases/concepts/types-of-databases) to organize your data in the right database, since data has gravity, it becomes harder with quantity of data to migrate data over time to other databases
- [My Experiences](https://deepaksood619.github.io/about-me/experience) over the years and [Social links](https://deepaksood619.github.io/about-me/social-links) to connect with me
