<p>Work as if you can solve anything.</p>

Megginson</p>
<p>Ultimately, the only way to truly be in control of your life is to be in control of your thoughts.</p>

<p>If you don&#x27;t look back at your past self from a year ago and feel ashamed, you aren&#x27;t progressing enough</p>

<p>&quot;To simplify before you understand the details is ignorance.</p>
<p>To simplify after you understand the details is genius.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A 5-step process for nearly anything:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore widely. Find out what is possible.</li>
<li>Test cheaply. Run small, quick experiments. Sample things.</li>
<li>Edit ruthlessly. Focus on the best. Cut everything else.</li>
<li>Repeat what works. Don&#x27;t quit on a good idea.</li>
<li>Return to 1.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>One who does not know ease is naturally in a state of dis-ease.</p>
<p>Reading can teach you the best of what others already know.</p>
<p>Reflection can teach you the best of what only you can know.</p>
<p>&quot;The math of success...</p>
<p>Results = (Hard Work*Time)^Strategy</p>
<p>Working hard is important, but working on the right thing is more important. A great strategy can deliver exponential results.</p>
<p>Of course, the best strategy is worth nothing if you never get to work. Zero to the millionth power is still zero.&quot;</p>
<p>Keep a check on how much of you and your activity is conscious or unconscious. Self-audit is self-transformation. -- Sadhguru</p>
<p>You can avoid reality, but you cannot avoid the consequences of avoiding reality.&quot; -- Ayn Rand</p>
<p>power of states, gods, and money: they are all mere myths that hold value only because we, collectively, decided to believe in them.</p>

<p>&quot;Successes are revised mistakes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Amazing social skills are a superpower.</p>
<p>The ability to deliver bad news in a good way is a superpower.</p>
<p>The ability to de-escalate a tense situation into a calm one is a superpower.</p>
<p>The ability to transform a lose/win situation into a win/win situation is a superpower.&quot;</p>
<p>To forgive does not mean to forget. To forgive means not to carry any bitterness in you, because that destroys your life -- Sadhguru</p>
<p>The most important conversation is the conversation you have with yourself each day.</p>
<p>Every story has a happy ending, you just need to know when to stop.</p>
<p>If you are looking at life as a possibility, you will see possibilities everywhere. If you are looking at life as a problem, you will see problems everywhere. -- Sadhguru</p>
<p>Your life is a limited amount of time. Only miserable people think it is long. If you are joyful and well, even if you live for a hundred years, it is too little. -- Sadhguru</p>
<p>If you want to enjoy stillness, you must be super alert. Deathlike stillness is of no value. When you become super alert but Still, possibilities open up. -- Sadhguru</p>
<p>Maturity is learning how to start when you feel like procrastinating and learning how to listen when you feel like talking.</p>
<p>Solve big problems early.</p>
<p>Rebound after one missed workout, not a decade of inactivity.</p>
<p>Repair a strained relationship the next day, not years later.</p>
<p>Fix overspending before it becomes a lifestyle.</p>
<p>Problems with simple solutions at first become difficult to unwind over time</p>
<p>The two most powerful warriors are patience and time -- Leo Tolstoy</p>
<p>Your attitude, not your aptitude, will determine your altitude -- Zig Ziglar</p>
<p>Everything that happens in the material world is essentially a certain kind of wave. If you are a good sailor, every wave is a possibility. -- Sadhguru</p>
<p>&quot;Where to focus:</p>
<p>For the beginner, execution.</p>
<p>For the intermediate, strategy.</p>
<p>For the expert, mindset.&quot;</p>
<p>What is mastery? At the heart of it, mastery is practice. Mastery is staying on the path.</p>
<p>&quot;If you do not work on important problems, how can you expect to do important work?&quot;</p>
<p>We have everything for the men&#x27;s need, but not for men&#x27;s greed -- Mahatma Gandhi</p>
<p>Eat till the point you are hungry and do not overeat. And you should leave at the point when people ask why are you leaving, rather than stay till people ask why don&#x27;t you leave</p>
<p>If you live joyfully until the last moment, you do not have to worry about death -- that will also be a joyful process. -- Sadhguru</p>
<p>If you want to have deep insights into life, other people&#x27;s opinion of you should not mean anything to you. -- Sadhguru</p>
<p>The joy of being one with everything will never be known to a person who is clinging to something or the other. -- Sadhguru</p>
<p>Whatever you have to do right now, do it with absolute involvement. Only then will you know the sweetness of what it means to be conscious. -- Sadhguru</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t live the same year 75 times and call it a life.</p>
<p>&quot;Clarity is the elimination of mental clutter.</p>
<p>Agility is the elimination of physical clutter.</p>
<p>Tranquility is the elimination of spiritual clutter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;School requires you to learn about things after the answer has already been decided.</p>
<p>Life requires you to learn about things while the answer is in the process of being decided.&quot;</p>
<p>If you are feeling really pleasant and wonderful, you will have no issues with anyone.</p>
<p>Once you are flexible, you are willing to listen; not just to someone&#x27;s talk -- you are willing to listen to life.</p>
<p>Especially if unpleasant things have happened in your life, you should become wise, not wounded.</p>
<p>You can attract luck simply by sharing your work publicly.</p>
<p>We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done. -- Alan Turing</p>
<p>If you can create the climate you want in your mind, emotions, and body, then your health, joy, and wellbeing will be taken care of. -- Sadhguru</p>
<p>Life is not a drama that is happening around you. Life is that fundamental dimension that is You. -- Sadhguru</p>
<p>The fundamental nature of jealousy and envy is a feeling of inadequacy. If you were really blissful, you would not be envious of anyone. -- Sadhguru</p>
<p>&quot;An approach that has worked well for me: Friendly, but persistent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;People generally have more control over their actions than their feelings.</p>
<p>But we can influence our feelings by taking action.</p>
<p>Take one small step. Move the body first and the mind will follow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is a wonderful, almost mystical, law of nature that says three of the things we want most - happiness, freedom, and peace of mind - are always attained when we give them to others. Give it away to get it back.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Repetition unlocks value.</p>
<p>The value of your first workout increases the more you exercise.</p>
<p>The value of your first article increases the more you write.</p>
<p>The value of your first conversation increases the longer you stay in the relationship.</p>
<p>Day One continues to compound.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;New goals don&#x27;t deliver new results. New lifestyles do.</p>
<p>And a lifestyle is a process, not an outcome.</p>
<p>For this reason, your energy should go into building better habits, not chasing better results.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Some things are better off ignored than attacked.</p>
<p>Attention is the oxygen of conflict. When you fight a problem, you breathe life into it. When you starve a problem of your attention, you suffocate it.</p>
<p>In a surprising number of cases, the way to solve a problem is to ignore it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Everything good needs time. Don&#x27;t do work in a hurry. Go into details; it pays in every way. Time means power for your work. Mediocrity is always in a rush; but whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing with consideration. For genius is nothing more nor less than doing well what anyone can do badly.&quot;</p>
<p>A seed that does not sprout is as good as a pebble. For the divine seed that you are to flourish, you have to open up. -- Sadhguru</p>
<p>People who excel tend to obsess over the details.</p>
<p>People who struggle also tend to obsess over the details.</p>
<p>The difference is what details they focus on. Minutiae vs polish.</p>
<p>Most things don&#x27;t matter - but when it does, you want to get the details right.</p>
<p>Do the people around me act the way I wish to act?</p>
<p>Language shapes thought, Thought shapes language</p>
<p>&quot;Always be prepared to absorb a big hit.</p>
<p>Always be focused enough to create a big win.</p>
<p>Diversified enough to survive, concentrated enough to matter.&quot;</p>
<p>Nobody is rooting for you to fail.</p>
<p>You may succeed. You may fail. But, for the most part, nobody cares one way or the other.</p>
<p>This is good. The world is big and you are small, which means you can chase your dreams with little worry for what people think.</p>
<p>If you want to find a better path, you have to be willing to explore a different path.</p>
<p>That sounds simple, but how often do you try something different?</p>
<p>The more you create, the more powerful you become.</p>
<p>The more you consume, the more powerful others become.</p>
<p>A good teacher does not teach facts, he or she teaches enthusiasm, open-mindedness and values.</p>
<p>All sorrows can be borne if you put them into a story or tell a story about them.</p>
<p>Do less. Keep returning to one thing and continue to refine it.</p>
<p>Stoic philosophers -- &quot;paradox of happiness&quot;: To attain happiness, we must not try to attain it.&quot;</p>
<p>Nearly everything in life is unfavorable once it grows to a certain size.</p>
<p>It is entirely possible to have too many clients, too much work, too much fame, too much free time, and so on.</p>
<p>Pay attention to when the thing you&#x27;re chasing exceeds its usefulness.</p>
<p>The strategies that made you successful in the past will, at some point, reach their limit.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t let your previous choices set your future ceiling. The willingness to try new ideas allows you to keep advancing.</p>
<p>&quot;Fasting focuses the mind - it replaces all desires with a single desire.&quot;</p>
<p>Your time is better spent championing good ideas than tearing down bad ones.</p>
<p>The best thing that can happen to a bad idea is that it is forgotten. The best thing that can happen to a good idea is that it is shared.</p>
<p>Feed the good ideas and let bad ideas die of starvation.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s better to be alone than to spend time with toxic people.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s better to do nothing than to work on something that doesn&#x27;t matter.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s better to rest than to climb the wrong mountain.&quot;</p>
<p>Mental toughness immediately increases when you find the right subject. You&#x27;re more likely to stick with things when you&#x27;re genuinely interested.</p>
<p>Every great opportunity has many reasons why it could fail. You have to trust your ability to solve problems along the way.</p>
<p>People who look for reasons why things won&#x27;t work, struggle to take action.</p>
<p>People who look for reasons why things will work - and solve problems as they arise - make things happen</p>
<p>Awareness is not a virtue in and of itself, not without a moral imperative -- Imani Perry</p>
<p>When in doubt, just say thank you. There is no downside. Are you honestly worried about showing too much gratitude to the people in your life?</p>
<p>Three simple ways to get more of what you want in life:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be kind and pleasant to others.</li>
<li>Ask for what you want.</li>
<li>Follow up.</li>
</ul>
<p>They tried to bury us. They didn&#x27;t know we were seeds.</p>
<p>Someone else living a good life does not prevent you from living a good life.</p>
<p>There are many ways to win and plenty of space.</p>
<p>You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.</p>
<p>You are the average of your five closest friends. On the internet, you&#x27;re a composite of all the shit you read and watch. Choose wisely.</p>
<p>The difference between good and great is often an extra round of revision.</p>
<p>The person who looks things over a second time will appear smarter or more talented, but actually is just polishing things a bit more.</p>
<p>Take the time to get it right. Revise it one extra time.</p>
<p>If you educate a man, you educate one man, but if you educate a woman you educate whole family and whole society</p>
<p>Knowledge, like other elements of life, should have no ownership. Therefore, high quality education should be made accessible to anyone and everyone without any financial obligations.</p>
<p>There is a high correlation between the amount of money you spend and amount of carbon you release, so more money you spend, the more carbon you release</p>
<p>An expert is someone who, over many years, manages to remain confident enough to keep trying and humble enough to keep learning</p>
<p>You have no responsibility to live up to someone else&#x27;s expectation of you.</p>
<p>Spend as little time as possible chasing other people&#x27;s preferences instead of your own.</p>
<p>Slowing down enables you to act in a high quality way.</p>
<p>Kind rather than curt. Polished rather than sloppy.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s hard to be thoughtful when you&#x27;re in a rush.</p>
<p>Life rarely changes in a positive way without an increase in responsibility.</p>
<p>That can mean taking ownership of your health or committing to a relationship or starting a business.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, if you want the trajectory to change, the amount of responsibility usually has to change.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re a beginner or an expert as long as you&#x27;re on the path.</p>
<p>If a beginner is on the path, all they need is time.</p>
<p>If an expert is off the path, they won&#x27;t be an expert for long.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good advice at the wrong time is bad advice.</p>
<p>Life is full of seasons and each season has different requirements.</p>
<p>Know what season you are in, and you can better identify which ideas to utilize.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The longer you&#x27;re a teacher, the less you remember what it is like to be a student.</p>
<p>The longer you&#x27;re a doctor, the less you remember what it is like to be a patient.</p>
<p>The longer you&#x27;re a coach, the less you remember what it is like to be a player.</p>
<p>Change positions. A new perspective can improve your old methods.&quot;</p>
<p>We don&#x27;t stop playing because we grow old. We grow old because we stop playing. - George Bernard Shaw, Irish Playwright</p>
<p>Everybody just uses everybody else to get what they want</p>
<p>How old would you be, if you don&#x27;t know how old you are?</p>
<p>Reputation is what other people know about you. Honor is what you know about yourself -- Lois McMaster Bujold</p>
<p>Overcoming poverty is not a gesture of charity. It is an act of justice. -- Nelson Mandela</p>
<p>Many situations in life are similar to going on a hike: the view changes once you start walking.</p>
<p>You don&#x27;t need all the answers right now. New paths will reveal themselves if you have the courage to get started.</p>
<p>Time will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t tell you how much time is spent worrying about decisions that don&#x27;t matter. To just be able to make a decision and see what happens is tremendously empowering, but that means you have to set up the situation such that when something does go wrong, you can fix it</p>
<p>The power of accurate observation is commonly called cynicism by those who have not got it -- George Bernard Shaw</p>
<p>&quot;The more precisely you define the problem, the more easily you can find a solution.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel bad&quot; can have a million causes.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&#x27;t sleep much last night and I haven&#x27;t exercised in a week&quot; has a very straightforward answer.&quot;</p>

<p>You Either Die A Hero, Or You Live Long Enough To See Yourself Become The Villain.&quot; -- batman</p>
<p>You are as good as your work, degree doesn&#x27;t matter</p>
<p><strong>The goal of adulthood is to let go of the other possible existences and to make the best of the one. A successful adult is one who understands that it doesn&#x27;t matter which life you ultimately pick, only that you live it well</strong></p>
<p>Nearly everything in life has a useful zone, a desired dose. Ten minutes in the sun can energize you. Ten hours in the sun can burn you. This concept applies to many things: work, relationships, hobbies, exercise, food.</p>
<p>What is your desired dose? What do you need right now? A little bit more or a little bit less?</p>
<p>To understand what is coming at you, you will need to learn what came before you</p>
<p>Smile because it confuses people</p>
<p>All I want to know is where I&#x27;m going to die, so I&#x27;ll never go there. -- Charlie Munger</p>
<p>Freedom of mind is the real freedom. A person whose mind is not free though he may not be in chains, is a slave, not a free man. One whose mind is not free, though he may not be in prisio, is a prisoner and not a free man. One whose mind is not free though alive, is no better than dead. Freedom of mind is the proof of one&#x27;s existence. -- Dr. B.R. Ambedkar</p>
<p>For those who expect everything, there are many curses.</p>
<p>For those who appreciate everything, there are many blessings.</p>
<p>Money is not the only way to improve life. Instead of widening your margin of profit, widen your margin of leisure. Instead of optimizing for money, optimize for time. Instead of seeking efficiency, seek recovery.</p>
<p>Many good opportunities are ruined for the dream of slightly better ones.</p>
<p>Would you have a more successful career if you had taken that other job or moved cities? Possibly. But your actual career will definitely suffer if you don&#x27;t commit to doing it to the best of your ability.</p>
<p>Would you be 10% happier in a different relationship? Maybe. Maybe not. But you&#x27;ll definitely be unhappy in the one you have if you spend all day thinking about what else is out there.</p>
<p>The surefire way to end up worse off is to agonize over unchosen options and fail to make the most of the one you selected. Every minute spent yearning for your unlived lives is a moment you can&#x27;t invest in the one you actually have.</p>
<p>Choices matter, but so does your level of commitment.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that the only way to encourage innovation is to give it to the young. The young have a great advantage in that they are ignorant. Because I think ignorance in science is very important. If you&#x27;re like me and you know too much you can&#x27;t try new things. I always work in fields of which I&#x27;m totally ignorant.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t react to toxic people. Not giving them a reaction when they desperately seek it, is far more powerful</p>
<p>Quality of life is having the freedom to make choices that are not fear based. Whether it&#x27;s the ability to choose the kinds of projects I want to take on and can learn from, or the ability to take a month off to travel. Freedom to choose is the ultimate luxury.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet&quot;.</p>
<p>Each of us must work for his own improvement, and at the same time share a general responsibility for all humanity, -- Marie Sklodowska-Curie</p>
<p>Truth is like poetry. And most people fucking hate poetry.</p>
<p>When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change. -- Max Planck</p>
<p>You could claim that anything&#x27;s real if the only basis for believing in it is that nobody&#x27;s proved it doesn&#x27;t exist! -- Hermione Granger, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows by J.K. Rowling</p>
<p>There is no greater fool than he who thinks himself wise; no one wiser than he who suspects he is a fool. -- Marguerite de Valois</p>
<p>A clever person solves a problem. A wise person avoids it - Albert Einstein</p>
<p>The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool. -- Richard P. Feynman</p>
<p>Everyone must choose one of two pains: The pain of discipline or the pain of regret.</p>
<p>Ordinary always feel threatened by outstanding.</p>
<p>The ability of a person to atone has always been the most remarkable of human features -- Leon Uris</p>
<p>Forgiveness for others becomes possible when we&#x27;ve held our own being with great compassion - Tara Brach</p>
<p>All of us live in a bubble which we incorrectly perceive as &quot;normal&quot;</p>
<p>If you don&#x27;t like something, <strong>change it</strong>. If you can&#x27;t change it, change your <strong>attitude</strong>. -- Maya Angelou</p>
<p>A man always has two reasons for doing anything, A good reason and the real reason -- J.P. Morgan</p>
<p>The flame that burns twice as bright, burns half as long</p>
<p>A belief is not dangerous until it turns absolute</p>
<p>We are just a chemical scum on a medium-sized planet, orbiting an average star in an ordinary galaxy in one of many universes</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Aristotle</strong></p>
<p>Think about time as divided into the past, the present and the future and then think for a while about what the present is, how thick is the present? The present is just the limit between the past and the future.</p>
<p>And then you get the paradox.</p>
<p>Because the past is something that does not exist, it has existed but it doesn&#x27;t exist any longer. The future is something that does not exist, it will exist, but it doesn&#x27;t exist. And the present is nothing - so the present seems to be a nothing dividing something non-existent from something non-existent.</p>

<p>“If you defer investing your time and energy until you see that you need to, chances are it will already be too late.” - Clayton Christensen</p>
<p>A tool is as powerful as a person wielding it.
The tool is only as effective as the skilfulness of the hands that wield it.
A tool is only as good as the person using it.</p>
<p>90 90 rule - when you think you are done with 90% of tasks, you are left with 90% of tasks</p>
<p>दूध का जला छाछ भी फूंक कर पीता हैं। का अर्थ है “ एक बार धोखा खाने पर अत्यधिक सावधान होना।”</p>
