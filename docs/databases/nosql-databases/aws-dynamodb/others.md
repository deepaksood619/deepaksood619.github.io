## PartiQL

You now can use [PartiQL](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/announcing-partiql-one-query-language-for-all-your-data/) with [NoSQL Workbench](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/workbench.html) to run SQL-compatible queries on your DynamoDB data. PartiQL makes it easier to interact with DynamoDB, and now you can use PartiQL to query, insert, update, and delete table data by using NoSQL Workbench.

## Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)

## Fully managed in-memory cache for DynamoDB

Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is a fully managed, highly available, in-memory [cache](https://aws.amazon.com/caching/) for [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) that delivers up to a 10x performance improvement -- from milliseconds to microseconds -- even at millions of requests per second. DAX does all the heavy lifting required to add in-memory acceleration to your DynamoDB tables, without requiring developers to manage cache invalidation, data population, or cluster management. Now you can focus on building great applications for your customers without worrying about performance at scale. You do not need to modify application logic, since DAX is compatible with existing DynamoDB API calls.
