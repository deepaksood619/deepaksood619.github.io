Amazon Redshift spatial provides location-based analytics for rich insights into your data. It seamlessly integrates spatial and business data to provide analytics for decision making.[Amazon Redshift launched native spatial data processing support in November 2019](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/11/amazon-redshift-announces-support-spatial-data/), with a polymorphic data type GEOMETRY and several key SQL spatial functions. We now support GEOGRAPHY data type, and our library of SQL spatial functions has grown to 80.
