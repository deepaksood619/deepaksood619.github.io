## Query Optimizer

Building a really good query optimizer and query execution system in a distributed database system is hard. It requires a number of sophisticated components including statistics, cardinality estimation, plan space search, the right storage structures, fast query execution operators, intelligent shuffle, both broadcast and point-to-point data transmission, and more.
