# Storage Cost Optimisation

Recommendation: Move from Logical to Physical Storage

## Physical vs Logical Storage

In BigQuery, =="logical storage" refers to the uncompressed size of your data, including any data retained for time travel and fail-safe storage, while "physical storage" represents the actual compressed size of the data stored on disk==, meaning it's the amount of space the data physically occupies on Google's servers; essentially, logical storage is the "apparent" size of your data, while physical storage is the "real" size after compression, with logical storage usually being cheaper per gigabyte than physical storage.

### Key differences

- **Size Calculation:** Logical storage is the uncompressed data size, whereas physical storage reflects the compressed size after data optimization.
- **Billing:** By default, BigQuery charges based on logical storage, which means you are not billed for the compression savings. However, you can choose to switch to physical storage billing if you want to pay based on the actual disk space used.
- **Time Travel and Fail-Safe Storage:** When using logical storage, time travel and fail-safe storage are included in the price, but when using physical storage, these features are billed separately at the "active storage" rate.

### When to use which

- **Logical Storage (default):** Use this if you want the simplest billing model and are not overly concerned about optimizing for storage costs, especially if you utilize features like time travel frequently.
- **Physical Storage:** If you have very large datasets with high compression potential and want to minimize storage costs, consider switching to physical storage billing.

## Charges

BigQuery charges based on active logical storage, which is often higher compared to physical storage due to the compression factor. Hereâ€™s how you can optimize this:

- **Understand Compression Benefits:** BigQuery's physical storage cost is based on compressed storage. Depending on the compression ratio of your data, you can potentially reduce storage costs significantly. For example, if your data compresses well (as per Bigquery Tables scan), you may only pay a fraction of the logical storage cost.
- **Compression Strategy:** Evaluate all your BigQuery Tables and choose appropriate Tables that will help reduce your overall cost of storage and query performance. For highly compressible data, the cost savings can be substantial (up to 30-40% savings compared to logical storage costs).

Example:

From the above snapshot and the storage cost information, we can deduce the following about the cost efficiency of physical storage over logical storage due to compression:

Logical Storage (us-multi region dataset)

- Active logical storage costs $0.02 per GiB per month.
- Long-term logical storage costs $0.01 per GiB per month.

Physical Storage (us-multi region dataset)

- Active physical storage costs $0.04 per GiB per month.
- Long-term physical storage costs $0.02 per GiB per month.

While the cost of physical storage is generally twice that of logical storage, effective compression can reduce the effective cost to as low as 1/5th of the original logical storage cost, depending on your data characteristics. This strategy can lead to significant cost savings over time.

Snapshot Data(us-multi region dataset)

- Total logical bytes: 287.77 GiB
- Total physical bytes: 78.74 GiB

### Cost Comparison

#### Without Compression (Logical Storage)

Active logical storage cost:

- 287.77 GiB * $0.02/GiB = $5.75 per month

Long-term logical storage cost:

- 287.77 GiB * $0.01/GiB = $2.88 per month

#### With Compression (Physical Storage)

Active physical storage cost:

- 78.74 GiB * $0.04/GiB = $3.15 per month

Long-term physical storage cost:

- 78.74 GiB * $0.02/GiB = $1.57 per month
Savings Analysis

#### Logical vs. Physical Storage (Active)

- Logical: $5.75 per month
- Physical: $3.15 per month
- Savings: $5.75 - $3.15 = $2.60 per month

#### Logical vs. Physical Storage (Long-term)

- Logical: $2.88 per month
- Physical: $1.57 per month
- Savings: $2.88 - $1.57 = $1.31 per month

### Conclusion

Due to compression, storing data physically is more cost-effective:

- For active storage, you save $2.60 per month.
- For long-term storage, you save $1.31 per month.

The compression reduces the physical storage size, thus lowering the overall cost despite the higher per-GiB rate for physical storage.

## Implementation Steps

### Programmatically change all the dataset whose cost is reduced due to compressed storage

Auto Deleting Tables that are not frequently used in a project with table Prefix â€™_bqc_â€™: This script is designed to automatically delete tables in a Google BigQuery dataset that are prefixed with "bqc" and have not been modified for a specified number of hours.

Why?

- This script would be useful in environments where there are many temporary or ephemeral tables that are not needed after a certain period.
- It helps in managing and cleaning up the dataset by removing old or unused tables, potentially reducing costs and improving manageability.

```python

client = bigquery.Client()
# Define your dataset and filter criteria
dataset_id = 'erazuthmohandasrakesh-emr.Banking'
prefix = '_bqc_'
hours_threshold = 8760 <--- change this to
