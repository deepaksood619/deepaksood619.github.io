# DORA Metrics

The [DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA)](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/the-2019-accelerate-state-of-devops-elite-performance-productivity-and-scaling) team has identified four key metrics that indicate the performance of a software development team:

- **Deployment Frequency**—How often an organization successfully releases to production
- **Lead Time for Changes**—The amount of time it takes a commit to get into production
- **Change Failure Rate**—The percentage of deployments causing a failure in production
- **Time to Restore Service**—How long it takes an organization to recover from a failure in production
