## Federated Identity

Afederated identityin [information technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology) is the means of linking a person's [electronic identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_identity) and attributes, stored across multiple distinct [identity management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management) systems.

Federated identity is related to [single sign-on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on)(SSO), in which a user's single [authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication) ticket, or [token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_token), is trusted across multiple IT systems or even organizations. SSO is a subset of [federated identity management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_identity_management), as it relates only to [authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication) and is understood on the level of technical interoperability and it would not be possible without some sort of federation.
