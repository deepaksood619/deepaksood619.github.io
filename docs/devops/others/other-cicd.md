## Weave Flux

Weaveworks are originally known for creating Weave Net, a container SDN now available as both a Docker plugin and Kubernetes CNI option. Today, the company offers an extensive and eye-candy dashboard and a cloud offering, Weave Cloud.[The Flux Operator](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux) for Kubernetes allows GitOps style CD & release management where operator fetches the changes from git push events and handles the deployments gracefully. It continuously tries to match the declaritive configuration to the actualy deployment in Kubernetes. The cloud offering also has nice UI and Prometheus integration which aims to help your Continuous Delivery pipelines.

## Flux

The GitOps Kubernetes operator

We believe in GitOps

- You declaratively describe the entire desired state of your system in git.This includes the apps, config, dashboards, monitoring and everything else.
- What can be described can be automated.Use YAMLs to enforce conformance of the system. You don't need to runkubectl, all changes go through git. Use diff tools to detect divergence between observed and desired state and get notifications.
- You push code not containers.Everything is controlled through pull requests. There is no learning curve for new devs, they just use your standard git PR process. The history in git allows you to recover from any snapshot as you have a sequence of transactions. It is much more transparent to make operational changes by pull request, e.g. fix a production issue via a pull request instead of making changes to the running system.

Flux is a tool that automatically ensures that the state of a cluster matches the config in git. It uses an operator in the cluster to trigger deployments inside Kubernetes, which means you don't need a separate CD tool. It monitors all relevant image repositories, detects new images, triggers deployments and updates the desired running configuration based on that (and a configurable policy).

The benefits are: you don't need to grant your CI access to the cluster, every change is atomic and transactional, git has your audit log. Each transaction either fails or succeeds cleanly. You're entirely code centric and don't need new infrastructure.

## DroneCI

Drone is a self-service Continuous Delivery platform for busy development teams.

Drone is a Container-Native, Continuous Delivery Platform

Drone is a Continuous Delivery system built on container technology. Drone uses a simple YAML configuration file, a superset of docker-compose, to define and execute Pipelines inside Docker containers.

## Argo

### Workflows and Pipelines

Container native workflow engine for Kubernetes supporting both DAG and step based workflows

Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. Argo Workflows is implemented as a Kubernetes CRD.

- Define workflows where each step in the workflow is a container.
- Model multi-step workflows as a sequence of tasks or capture the dependencies between tasks using a graph (DAG).
- Easily run compute intensive jobs for machine learning or data processing in a fraction of the time using Argo Workflows on Kubernetes.
- Run CI/CD pipelines natively on Kubernetes without configuring complex software development products.

### Continuous Delivery

Declarative Continuous Delivery following Gitops

Application definitions, configurations, and environments should be declarative and version controlled. Application deployment and lifecycle management should be automated, auditable, and easy to understand.

### Advanced Deployment Controller

Additional Kubernetes deployment strategies such as Blue-Green and Canary

### Events

Event based dependency manager for Kubernetes

What Argo does differently is how they manage the actual CI/CD. It is specifically developed for Kubernetes and integrates with it through CRD's (Custom Resource Definitions). It defines a new CRD which is the 'Workflow'. In this workflow you define what needs to happen by laying out steps in a yaml format. Each step runs inits own Docker containeron your own Kubernetes cluster.
