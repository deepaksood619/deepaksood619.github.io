# CoreSync, Pacemaker

Corosync is an open source program that provides cluster membership and messaging capabilities, often referred to as themessaginglayer, to client servers. Pacemaker is an open source cluster resource manager (CRM), a system that coordinates resources and services that are managed and made highly available by a cluster. In essence, Corosync enables servers to communicate as a cluster, while Pacemaker provides the ability to control how the cluster behaves.
