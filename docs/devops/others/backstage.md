# Backstage

Internal Developer Portal (IDP)

An open platform for building developer portals

Powered by a centralized software catalog, Backstage restores order to your infrastructure and enables your product teams to ship high-quality code quickly — without compromising autonomy.

- [Backstage Software Catalog](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/) for managing all your software (microservices, libraries, data pipelines, websites, ML models, etc.)
- [Backstage Software Templates](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/) for quickly spinning up new projects and standardizing your tooling with your organization’s best practices
- [Backstage TechDocs](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/) for making it easy to create, maintain, find, and use technical documentation, using a "docs like code" approach
