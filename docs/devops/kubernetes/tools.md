## Kops (Kubernetes Operations)

The easiest way to get a production grade Kubernetes cluster up and running.

Production Grade K8s Installation, Upgrades, and Management

### What is kops?

We like to think of it askubectlfor clusters.

kopshelps you create, destroy, upgrade and maintain production-grade, highly available, Kubernetes clusters from the command line. AWS (Amazon Web Services) is currently officially supported, with GCE in beta support , and VMware vSphere in alpha, and other platforms planned.

https://github.com/kubernetes/kops

## kubeadm

kubeadm helps you bootstrap a minimum viable Kubernetes cluster that conforms to best practices.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/create-cluster-kubeadm

## Stern / logs

Stern allows you to tail multiple pods on Kubernetes and multiple containers within the pod. Each result is color coded for quicker debugging.

The query is a regular expression so the pod name can easily be filtered and you don't need to specify the exact id (for instance omitting the deployment id). If a pod is deleted it gets removed from tail and if a new pod is added it automatically gets tailed.

When a pod contains multiple containers Stern can tail all of them too without having to do this manually for each one. Simply specify thecontainerflag to limit what containers to show. By default all containers are listened to.

```bash
brew install stern
stern decision-engine

Tail the gateway container running inside of the envvars pod on staging
    stern --context staging --container gateway envvars
Show auth activity from 15min ago with timestamps
    stern -t --since 15m auth
Follow the development of some-new-feature in minikube
    stern --context minikube some-new-feature
View pods from another namespace
stern --namespace kube-system kubernetes-dashboard
```

## Kubetail

## telepresence

Local development against a remote Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster

Telepresence allows you to run your code locally while still:

1. Giving your code access to Services in a remote Kubernetes cluster.
2. Giving your code access to cloud resources like AWS RDS or Google PubSub.
3. Allowing Kubernetes to access your code as if it were in a normal pod within the cluster.
