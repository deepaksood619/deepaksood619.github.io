1. Path

2. Shortest path

3. Topological Sorting (can you draw a digraph so that all edges point upwards)

4. Strong Connectivity

5. Transitive closure (For which vertices v and w is there a path from v to w)

6. PageRank

## Digraph Search

1. Reachability - Find all vertices reachable from s along a directed path. (Use DFS)

## Edge-Weighted Graph API

We use adjacency-list representation for representing a weighted graph, where each edge has a weight associated with it
