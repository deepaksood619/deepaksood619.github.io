# Space-partitioning trees

Use a tree to represent a recursive subdivision of 2d space

## Grid - Divide space uniformly into squares

## 2d tree - Recursively divide space into two halfplanes

## Quadtree / Rtree - Recursively divide space into four quadrants

It is a two-dimensional analog of octrees and is most often used to partition a two-dimensional space by recursively subdividing it into four quadrants or regions.

## BSP tree - Recursively divide space into two regions

## Applications

- Ray tracing
- 2d range search
- Flight simulators
- N-body simulation
- Collision detection
- Astronomical databases
- Nearest neighbor search
- Adaptive mesh generation
- Accelerate rendering in Doom (game)
- Hidden surface removal and shadow casting
𝗥𝗔𝗬 𝗖𝗔𝗦𝗧𝗜𝗡𝗚

It is the most basic of many computer graphics rendering algo that uses geometric algo of ray tracing.
