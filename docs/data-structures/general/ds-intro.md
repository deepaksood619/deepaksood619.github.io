## Types

### Implicit Data Structure

In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), a **implicit [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure)** or **space-efficient data structure** is a data structure that stores very little information other than the main or required data: a data structure that requires low [overhead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhead_(computing)). They are called "implicit" because the position of the elements carries meaning and relationship between elements.

Formally, an implicit data structure is one with constant*O*(1)space overhead

### Explicit data structure

### Succinct data structure

A **succinct data structure** is a [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) which uses an amount of space that is "close" to the [information-theoretic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information-theoretic) lower bound, but (unlike other compressed representations) still allows for efficient query operations.

## Linear Data Structure (they all have a logical start and a logical end)

1. Array
2. Linked List
   - Doubly Linked List
   - Circular Linked List
3. Stack
4. Queue
   - Queue FIFO
   - Dequeue
   - Randomized Queue
   - Priority Queue (Using array)

## Hierarchical Data Structure

1. Tree(Ex - Family tree, HTML DOM)
   - Binary Tree
   - Binary Search Tree
   - AVL Tree
   - 2-3 Tree
   - Red Black Tree
2. Trie
3. Heap
   - Binary Heap
   - Fibonacci Heap
4. Hash Map
5. Graph
   - Undirected graph
   - Directed graph
6. Rope (Efficient for String concatenation)
