# Chord

In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing), Chordis a protocol and [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) for a [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer)[distributed hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table). A distributed hash table stores [key-value pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array) by assigning keys to different computers (known as "nodes"); a node will store the values for all the keys for which it is responsible. Chord specifies how keys are assigned to nodes, and how a node can discover the value for a given key by first locating the node responsible for that key.
Chord is one of the four original [distributed hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table) protocols, along with [CAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_addressable_network), [Tapestry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapestry_(DHT)), and [Pastry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastry_(DHT)). It was introduced in 2001 by [Ion Stoica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Stoica), [Robert Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Tappan_Morris), [David Karger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Karger), [Frans Kaashoek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frans_Kaashoek), and [Hari Balakrishnan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hari_Balakrishnan), and was developed at [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT).
