Probabilistic data structures are a group of data structures that are extremely useful for big data and streaming applications. Generally speaking, these data structures use hash functions to randomize and compactly represent a set of items. Collisions are ignored but errors can be well-controlled under certain threshold. Comparing with error-free approaches, these algorithms use much less memory and have constant query time. They usually support union and intersection operations and therefore can be easily parallelized.

2. **Cardinality - HyperLogLog**

3. **Frequency - Count-Min Sketch**

4. **Frequency Estimation: Count-Mean-Min Sketch**

5. **Locality-sensitive hashing**(**LSH**)

## Others

## Frugal Streaming

It uses only one unit of memory per group to compute a quantile for each group.

## Use case: Find the nth percentile of the data stream
