## Doris

Open Source, Real-Time Data Warehouse

Apache Doris is a modern data warehouse for real-time analytics. It delivers lightning-fast analytics on real-time data at scale.

Apache Doris is an easy-to-use, high-performance and real-time analytical database based on MPP architecture, known for its extreme speed and ease of use. It only requires a sub-second response time to return query results under massive data and can support not only high-concurrency point query scenarios but also high-throughput complex analysis scenarios.

All this makes Apache Doris an ideal tool for scenarios including report analysis, ad-hoc query, unified data warehouse, and data lake query acceleration. On Apache Doris, users can build various applications, such as user behavior analysis, AB test platform, log retrieval analysis, user portrait analysis, and order analysis.
