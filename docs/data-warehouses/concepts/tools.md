## Informatica PowerCenter / IICS

Informatica PowerCenter is a tool for extracting, transforming, and loading data from sources. It's used to create data warehouses for industries. Informatica PowerCenter can connect to:

- Enterprise database systems
- Mainframe systems
- Middleware
- Midrange systems
- Analytics tools like Tableau
- Cloud-based systems like Microsoft Azure and AWS

Informatica Intelligent Cloud Services (IICS) is a cloud-based platform for integrating and synchronizing data and applications. IICS offers similar functionality to PowerCenter, but it can be accessed via the internet. IICS allows users to run ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) codes in the cloud.

Some transformations in IICS include:

- Lookup Transformation
- Joiner Transformation
- Union Transformation
- Normalizer Transformation
- Hierarchy Parser Transformation
- Hierarchy Builder Transformation
- Transaction Control Transformation
- WebServices Transformation

### MDM Processing

In Informatica, merging records typically refers to consolidating multiple records into a single, authoritative record, often referred to as a "**golden record.**" This process involves identifying duplicate or related records and combining their data to create a comprehensive, unified representation. Informatica's MDM (Master Data Management) solutions, such as MDM Hub and C360 SaaS, provide tools and workflows to facilitate this process, either automatically or through manual intervention.

#### 1. Identifying Duplicate or Related Records

- **Match and Merge:** Informatica uses match rules and algorithms to identify potential matches or duplicates based on specific fields or combinations of fields.
- **Manual Review:** In some cases, a manual review of potential matches may be necessary to ensure accurate merging, especially when dealing with complex relationships or ambiguous data.
- **Search and Query:** Users can use search functionalities within Informatica MDM to find and select records for merging.

#### 2. Merging Process

- **Automatic Merging:** In some scenarios, records can be automatically merged based on predefined rules and trust levels.
- **Manual Merging:** Users can manually select records to merge and review the merged data to ensure accuracy.
- **Surviving Records:** During the merge process, Informatica determines which fields from the original records will be retained in the merged record, often based on trust levels or recency.

#### 3. Tools and Workflows

- **Data Steward Workbench (MDM Hub):** This workbench provides tools like Merge Manager for reviewing and managing merging activities.
- **Merge Manager:** This component allows users to view records queued for merging, review potential matches, and manually merge records.
- **Data Director:** This component (part of C360 SaaS) provides a user interface for navigating and managing master data, including merging records.
- **REST APIs:** Informatica provides REST APIs for programmatic merging of records, enabling integration with other systems and workflows.

#### 4. Key Considerations

- **Match Rules:** Properly defining match rules is crucial for accurately identifying duplicate records.
- **Trust Levels:** Understanding and utilizing trust levels to prioritize data from different sources is essential for creating authoritative golden records.
- **Data Governance:** Establishing clear data governance policies and processes is necessary for ensuring the accuracy and consistency of merged data.

## DVC

[DVC](https://dvc.org/) stands for "data version control". This project invites data scientists and engineers to a Git-inspired world, where all workflow versions are tracked, along with all the data artifacts and models, as well as associated metrics.

**Data Version Control** or **DVC** is a command line tool and [VS Code Extension](https://github.com/iterative/dvc#vs-code-extension) to help you develop reproducible machine learning projects:

1. **Version** your data and models. Store them in your cloud storage but keep their version info in your Git repo.
2. **Iterate** fast with lightweight pipelines. When you make changes, only run the steps impacted by those changes.
3. **Track** experiments in your local Git repo (no servers needed).
4. **Compare** any data, code, parameters, model, or performance plots.
5. **Share** experiments and automatically reproduce anyone's experiment.

## DBT

Analytics engineering is the data transformation work that happens between loading data into your warehouse and analyzing it. dbt allows anyone comfortable with SQL to own that workflow.

With dbt, data teams work directly within the warehouse to produce trusted datasets for reporting, ML modeling, and operational workflows.

![DBT Platform](../../media/Pasted%20image%2020230308224022.jpg)

dbt is a SQL-first transformation workflow that lets teams quickly and collaboratively deploy analytics code following software engineering best practices like modularity, portability, CI/CD, and documentation. Now anyone on the data team can safely contribute to production-grade data pipelines.

#### Airbyte’s replication modes

- What is Airbyte’s ELT approach to data integration?
- Why is ELT preferred over ETL?
- What is a cursor?
- What is a primary key used for?
- What is the difference between full refresh replication and incremental sync replication?
- What does it mean to append data rather than overwrite it in the destination?
- How is incremental sync with deduped history different from incremental sync with append?
- What are the advantages of log-based change data capture (CDC) replication versus standard replication?
- Which replication mode should you choose?

| Full refresh replication | Incremental sync replication |
| ---- | ---- |
| The **entire data set** will be retrieved from the source and sent to the destination on each sync run. | Only records that have been **inserted or updated** in the source system since the previous sync run are sent to the destination. |
