# Faster Python

1. Line Profiling
2. Numpy Vectorization
3. Specilized data structures

   - scipy.spatial

    For spatial query like distances, nearest neighbor, kd trees etc.

    - pandas

    for SQL-like grouping or aggregation

    - xarray

    for grouping across multiple dimensions

    - scipy.sparse

    sparse matrices for 2-dimensional structured data

    - sparse package

    for N-dimensional structured data

    - scipy.sparse.csgraph

    for graph-like problems (e.g. finding shortest paths)

4. CPython
5. Numba

## Optimizing Python Memory Objects

## Performant Python (reducing memory usage)

- Tuples save a bit of memory when replacing lists
- **Tuples save lots of memory when replacing dictionaries**
- Generators save memory only for large tuples, but are faster to iterate
- **Slotted classes save a lot of memory**
- Namedtuples are better than classes but worse than slotted classes
- Map and filter are sometimes faster than comprehensions
