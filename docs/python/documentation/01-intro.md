## Facts

In Python, integer precision is limited only to the constraints of your hardware, Python is well-capable of interpreting literally millions (and even billions) of bits of precision.

```python
import sys

sys.maxsize

sys.float_info

Python autopromotes from int to long int if the value is large

Running

python test.py

Creating executable

chmod +x test.py

./test.py
```
