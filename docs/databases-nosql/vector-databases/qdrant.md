# Qdrant

It is an open-source vector database built for AI and semantic search applications. It is designed to store, index, and search high-dimensional vectors, often generated by machine learning models (e.g., embeddings from LLMs or image models).

### Key Features

- High-Performance Search: Utilizes the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm for fast and accurate nearest neighbor searches.[](https://blog.futuresmart.ai/comprehensive-guide-to-qdrant-vector-db-installation-and-setup?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- Advanced Filtering: Supports filtering during vector search, allowing for more precise results based on metadata.
- Payload Support: Allows attaching metadata (payload) to vectors, which can be used for filtering and enriching search results.
- Quantization: Offers vector quantization techniques to reduce memory usage and improve search performance.
- Scalability: Designed to handle massive datasets, making it suitable for large-scale AI applications.
- Multi-Language Support: Provides client libraries for Python, Go, Rust, and TypeScript, facilitating integration into various tech stacks.
- Cloud & On-Premises Deployment: Available as a fully managed cloud service (Qdrant Cloud) and can also be self-hosted using Docker or Kubernetes

### Pros

- Extremely fast and lightweight (written in Rust).
- Great performance for large-scale, real-time applications.
- Supports hybrid search (text + vector).
- Simple integration with external embedding models.
- Active open-source community and well-documented.

### Cons

- No native graph-like relationships (unlike Weaviate).
- May require more orchestration for complex data workflows.
- Lacks built-in ML model hostingâ€”you bring your own embeddings.
- Fewer governance and RBAC features compared to Weaviate.
