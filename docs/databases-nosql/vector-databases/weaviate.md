# Weaviate

Open-source, cloud-native vector search engine and database designed to store, index, and search data based on semantic meaning via vector embeddings.

It supports both semantic vector search and knowledge graph functionality.

## Key Components

### 1. Core Engine

- **Language:** Written in Go, ensuring performance and scalability.
- **Functionality:** Handles vector indexing, search, and CRUD operations.
- **Deployment:** Supports Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm for flexible deployment options.

### 2. Modules

- **Purpose:** Extend Weaviate's capabilities with additional features.
- Examples:
	- Text2Vec: Converts text into vector embeddings.
	- Image2Vec: Converts images into vector embeddings.
	- Hugging Face, OpenAI, Cohere: Integrate with external ML models for vectorization.

### 3. API Interfaces

- **RESTful API:** Allows interaction with Weaviate using standard HTTP methods.
- **GraphQL API:** Provides a flexible query language for more complex data retrieval.

### 4. Schema Management  

- **Schema Definition:** Users can define classes and properties to structure their data.
- **Flexibility:** Supports dynamic schema updates and versioning.

### 5. Persistence Layer  

- **Storage:** Utilizes a combination of in-memory and disk-based storage for efficiency.
- **Replication:** Supports data replication for high availability and fault tolerance.

## Integration with Qwen3, Graphiti, and Langraph

1. **Vector Search & Knowledge Graph Integration:** Weaviate excels at combining semantic vector search with graph-based data modeling. This dual capability aligns well with your need to store and retrieve data based on both meaning and relationships.
2. **Seamless Integration with Qwen3:** While specific integrations with Qwen3 are not detailed, Weaviate's support for external model providers like OpenAI, Hugging Face, and Cohere suggests that integrating Qwen3 for generating embeddings is feasible.
3. **Compatibility with LangChain:** Weaviate is a supported vector store in LangChain, allowing you to use it as a backend for storing and retrieving embeddings generated by language models.
4. **Modular Architecture:** Weaviate's modular design allows you to extend its capabilities with additional functionalities, such as custom vectorizers or rerankers, which can enhance your application's performance.
5. **Multi-Tenancy Support:** Weaviate supports multi-tenancy, enabling you to isolate data for different users or applications within the same instance, which is beneficial for scalable applications.

## Minor Limitations

- **Ecosystem maturity:** Compared to some legacy databases or specialized graph DBs, Weaviate’s ecosystem is still growing. Sometimes advanced graph queries might be better handled by dedicated graph DBs.
- **Integration effort:** Requires some engineering to glue components perfectly, especially with complex workflows involving multiple AI modules.
