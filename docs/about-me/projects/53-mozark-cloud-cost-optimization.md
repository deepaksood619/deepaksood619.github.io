# Mozark - Cloud Cost Optimization and Performance Enhancement

## Client Overview

- **Client:** Mozark
- **Industry:** Technology
- **Objective:** Reduce AWS costs, enhance database performance, and create a scalable architecture.
- Initial AWS Monthly Costs - $20,000
- Optimized AWS Monthly Costs - $12,000

## Approach

### 1. Infrastructure Assessment

We conducted a detailed assessment of Mozark's AWS infrastructure to identify inefficiencies and potential cost-saving opportunities. This included analyzing compute resources, storage, database configurations, and overall architecture.

### 2. DevOps Optimization

#### a. EC2 Instance Right-Sizing and Upgrading

- Right-sized EC2 instances to better match workload requirements, ensuring optimal resource utilization.
- Migrated instances from older Intel-based instances to newer AMD and Graviton instances, achieving better performance at a lower cost.

#### b. Cleanup of Unused Resources

- Conducted thorough cleanups of unused resources across multiple environments and accounts, including unattached EBS volumes, obsolete snapshots, and unused Elastic IPs.

### 3. Database Optimization

#### a. Database Performance Tuning

- Performed extensive performance tuning on existing databases, including indexing, query optimization, and sharding strategies.

#### b. Rightsizing and Scaling

- Right-sized database instances based on actual usage patterns to optimize cost and performance.
- Implemented auto-scaling solutions to handle varying loads dynamically, ensuring cost efficiency and performance.

#### c. Database Migration and Modernization

- Migrated databases to more cost-effective and scalable solutions like Amazon RDS and Aurora.
- Upgraded database versions to leverage new features and performance improvements, ensuring compatibility and extended support.
- Move to gp3 volumes from provisioned IOPS disk, achieving significant cost savings

#### d. Backup and Recovery Optimization

- Optimized backup strategies to reduce storage costs and improve recovery times.
- Implemented automated backup and recovery solutions to enhance data protection and availability.

### 4. Additional Activities

#### a. Savings Plans and Reserved Instances

- Purchased savings plans for EC2 instances to secure long-term cost reductions.
- Implemented RIs for RDS to take advantage of significant savings over on-demand pricing.

#### b. Architecture Scalability Enhancements

- Redesigned the architecture to ensure scalability and flexibility, supporting future growth and peak loads.
- Implemented microservices architecture where applicable to improve modularity and manageability.

### 5. Performance and Reliability

#### a. Enhanced Monitoring and Alerting

- Implemented comprehensive monitoring and alerting solutions using AWS CloudWatch and third-party tools.
- Set up automated alerting for critical events to ensure timely resolution and minimize downtime.

## Results

### Cost Savings

- **Initial Monthly Cost:** $20,000
- **Optimized Monthly Cost:** $12,000
- **Total Monthly Savings:** $8,000 (approx. 40% reduction)

### Performance Improvements

- **Database Performance:** Enhanced by an average of 50% through tuning and caching mechanisms.
- **Scalability:** Improved architecture scalability to handle future growth and varying loads efficiently.

### Reliability and Manageability

- **Uptime:** Achieved near-zero downtime through robust backup, recovery, and monitoring solutions.
- **Manageability:** Enhanced through modular architecture and automated routine tasks.

## Conclusion

Through strategic optimizations on both the DevOps and DBA sides, Opstree successfully reduced Mozark's AWS costs by approximately 40%, while significantly enhancing database performance and creating a scalable architecture.
