Case Study: Enhancing Productivity at Careers360 with GenAI and Amazon Bedrock

## Client Overview

Careers360 is a prominent educational platform offering insights, reviews, and guidance to millions of students and professionals across India. The platform relies heavily on content creation, research, and updates to maintain its relevance in the rapidly changing educational landscape.

## Challenge

Careers360’s content team faced significant challenges in conducting extensive research for various articles, reviews, and guides. With a large repository of internal documents, public blogs, and an ever-increasing volume of content, the team often found themselves overwhelmed, spending hours manually searching through documents to gather information.

## Solution by Opstree

To address this challenge, Opstree leveraged **Amazon Bedrock** to implement a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** model. The core idea was to streamline the research process for Careers360’s content creators by building an advanced AI-driven knowledgebase capable of retrieving accurate and targeted information in real-time.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Knowledge Base Creation
    
- All internal documents, including public blogs and internal guides, were collated to form the foundation of the knowledge base.
- A real-time update mechanism was implemented to ensure the knowledgebase was always current with the latest information.

### 2. Integration with GenAI

- Using Amazon Bedrock, a GenAI model was built on top of the knowledgebase.
- The RAG model enabled content creators to perform targeted research by querying the AI tool, which would retrieve specific, relevant information from the knowledgebase, vastly improving response time.

### 3. Customized for Careers360

- The model was fine-tuned to understand Careers360’s tone, style, and specific needs, making it more relevant for their content creation process.
- The system provided curated information that met the nuanced requirements of the content team, ensuring higher accuracy and relevance.

## Results
