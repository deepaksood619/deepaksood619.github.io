# Pull Request Risk Tagging Heuristics

## What are all the heuristics that can be used to create a AI model that can create a "change risk tag" if the code changes is risky or not

Creating an AI model to assess the risk of code changes and generate a "change risk tag" involves considering various heuristics that capture different aspects of risk. Here are the key heuristics that can be used:

### Code Complexity Heuristics

1. **Lines of Code (LOC):** More lines of code may indicate higher risk. (Available)
2. **Cyclomatic Complexity:** Higher complexity can mean more potential for bugs.
3. **Code Churn:** Frequency and volume of changes to a particular code file or module.
4. **Code Dependencies:** Number and complexity of dependencies affected by the change.
5. **Code Coverage:** Extent of unit test coverage on the changed code.
6. **DML changes:** If new columns are removed
7. Configuration changes

### Historical Data Heuristics

1. **Past Bug Frequency:** Historical bug count in the code being changed.
2. **Past Change Frequency:** How often the code has been changed in the past.
3. **Developer Experience:** Developer’s familiarity and experience with the codebase.

### Code Quality Heuristics

1. **Static Code Analysis:** Results from tools like SonarQube indicating potential code quality issues.
2. **Linting Errors/Warnings:** Number and severity of linting issues.
3. **Code Review Feedback:** Historical feedback from code reviews on similar changes.

### Testing Heuristics

1. **Test Coverage:** Percentage of the changed code covered by tests.
2. **Test Pass Rate:** Historical pass rate of tests related to the changed code.
3. **Test Execution Results:** Results from unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

### Deployment Heuristics

1. **Deployment Frequency:** How often changes are deployed to production.
2. **Deployment Success Rate:** Historical success rate of deployments involving similar changes.
3. **Rollback Frequency:** How often changes need to be rolled back post-deployment.

### Code Review Heuristics

1. **Review Comments:** Number and nature of comments from code reviewers.
2. **Time to Review:** Amount of time taken for code review.
3. **Review Approval Rate:** Approval rate of similar changes in past reviews.

### Change Scope Heuristics

1. **Number of Files Changed:** More files can indicate a higher risk.
2. **Affected Modules:** Criticality of the modules affected by the change.
3. **Cross-Team Impact:** Changes that impact multiple teams or services.

### Operational Metrics Heuristics

1. **Performance Metrics:** Potential impact on system performance metrics.
2. **Error Rates:** Potential impact on error rates post-change.
3. **User Impact:** Potential impact on user-facing features and services.

### Contextual Heuristics

1. **Release Timing:** Proximity to major releases or deadlines.
2. **Business Criticality:** Importance of the feature or fix being implemented.
3. **Regulatory Impact:** Potential regulatory or compliance implications.

### Developer-Related Heuristics

1. **Commit Frequency:** Frequency of commits by the developer.
2. **Commit Size:** Size of the commits made by the developer.
3. **Collaboration:** Degree of collaboration on the change (e.g., pair programming).

### Environmental Heuristics

1. **Environmental Stability:** Stability of the environment where changes are being made.
2. **Configuration Changes:** Changes to configuration files or environment settings.
3. **Infrastructure Changes:** Changes to infrastructure components (e.g., database schema changes).

### AI/ML-Based Heuristics

1. **Anomaly Detection:** Use machine learning to detect anomalies in code changes compared to historical data.
2. **Predictive Models:** Models trained on historical data to predict the likelihood of issues.
3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Analyze commit messages and comments for risk indicators.

By integrating these heuristics into a comprehensive model, you can assess the risk associated with code changes and generate meaningful "change risk tags" to guide development and deployment decisions.

## How to build this

Building an AI model to generate "change risk tags" for code changes involves several steps, including data collection, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment. Here’s a detailed guide to building such a model:

### 1. Data Collection

#### Source Data

- ****Version Control Systems:**** Collect data from systems like Git or SVN (commit history, lines of code changed, commit messages).
- **Issue Tracking Systems:** Data from Jira, Bugzilla, etc. (bug reports, feature requests, task completions).
- **Code Review Tools:** Data from tools like Gerrit, Phabricator, or GitHub/GitLab (review comments, approval/rejection).
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Logs from Jenkins, CircleCI, TravisCI (build success/failure rates, deployment logs).
- **Static Code Analysis Tools:** Reports from SonarQube, ESLint, etc.
- **Testing Tools:** Test coverage reports, test execution results.
- **Performance Monitoring Tools:** Metrics from tools like New Relic, Datadog (performance data, error rates).

### 2. Data Preprocessing
