# Careers360 Cost Optimization

## Client Overview

- Client: Careers360
- Industry: Education Services
- Objective: Reduce AWS costs while enhancing application performance and eliminating outages.

## Background

Careers360, a leading education services provider, was facing escalating AWS costs coupled with performance bottlenecks and regular service outages. Opstree was engaged to address these issues and deliver a more cost-effective, reliable, and high-performance infrastructure.

## Initial AWS Costs

- March: $45,513.97
- April: $48,195.00
- May: $50,025.67

## Optimized AWS Costs

- June: $36,360
- July: $32,000
- August: $28,000

## Approach

### 1. Infrastructure Assessment

We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the existing AWS infrastructure, identifying key areas of inefficiency and potential cost savings. This included analyzing instance utilization, storage costs, data transfer charges, and service dependencies.

### 2. Resource Optimization

#### a. Instance Right-Sizing

We performed an in-depth analysis of EC2 instance usage and identified over-provisioned instances. By right-sizing these instances to better match workload requirements, we achieved significant cost reductions without impacting performance.

#### b. Auto-Scaling Implementation

We implemented auto-scaling policies to dynamically adjust the number of running instances based on actual demand. This ensured optimal resource utilization during peak and off-peak times, further reducing costs.

### 3. Storage Cost Reduction

#### a. Storage Tiering

We moved infrequently accessed data to cheaper storage tiers (e.g., S3 Infrequent Access or Glacier), significantly lowering storage costs while maintaining data availability.

#### b. Snapshot Optimization

By optimizing the use of EBS snapshots and leveraging incremental backups, we reduced storage overheads and costs associated with data backups.

### 4. Network Cost Management

#### a. Data Transfer Optimization

We optimized data transfer patterns to minimize inter-region and inter-AZ data transfer costs. This involved redesigning the architecture to localize traffic and reduce cross-region data movement.

### 5. Performance Enhancements

#### a. API Response Time Reduction

We optimized API endpoints by:

- Implementing caching mechanisms using AWS services like ElastiCache.
- Refactoring inefficient code and database queries.
- Leveraging content delivery networks (CDNs) to reduce latency and improve response times.

#### b. Database Performance Tuning

We performed database performance tuning, including indexing, query optimization, and sharding strategies, to improve overall database response times and handle higher loads efficiently.

### 6. Outage Elimination

#### a. High Availability and Fault Tolerance

We re-architected the application to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. This included:

- Implementing multi-AZ deployments for critical services.
- Utilizing AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to distribute traffic evenly across instances.
- Setting up automated failover mechanisms to handle instance failures seamlessly.

#### b. Monitoring and Alerting

We enhanced monitoring and alerting using AWS CloudWatch and third-party tools to proactively detect and address potential issues before they resulted in outages.

## Results

### Cost Savings

- March to May Total Cost: $143,734.64
- June to August Total Cost: $96,360

Total Savings: $47,374.64 (approx. 33% reduction)

### Performance Improvements

- API Response Time: Reduced by an average of 20%
- Major and Total Outages: Reduced to zero, achieving 99.9999% uptime

## Conclusion

Through strategic optimization of AWS resources, performance tuning, and robust architectural improvements, Opstree successfully reduced Careers360's AWS costs by approximately 33% while significantly enhancing application performance and eliminating outages. This case study demonstrates Opstree's capability to deliver cost-effective and high-performance solutions tailored to client needs.

## Future Plans

Building on the success of this project, Careers360 plans to further collaborate with Opstree for ongoing infrastructure optimization and performance enhancements to support their growing business needs.
