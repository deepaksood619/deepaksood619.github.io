## Financial Technology (FinTech) Credit Risk Analysis and Modeling Case Study

### Challenges

The FinTech company needed to expedite loan approvals while reducing Non-Performing Assets (NPAs). Traditional credit risk methods resulted in slower processing times and suboptimal loan terms, negatively impacting customer satisfaction.

### Solution by Opstree

Opstree developed an AI-based credit risk analysis solution using a combination of supervised models, including **logistic regression** with **PSI/CSI tracking** to ensure model accuracy. Using **scikit-learn**, Opstree trained custom credit risk models and deployed them using **Python (FastAPI)**, which enabled efficient real-time decision-making.

Additionally, **Amazon SageMaker** was used to automate model retraining, while **PowerBI** provided detailed analytics and dashboards to track credit risk performance. Opstree also incorporated clustering algorithms to assess borrower risk profiles based on alternative data sources such as transactional patterns and social profiles.

### Results

The credit risk AI solution revolutionized the company's lending operations, improving loan approval speed and accuracy while reducing NPAs. The detailed analytics allowed the company to optimize lending terms and improve customer satisfaction.

- Reduced NPAs from 9% to 6%.
- Reduced delinquency rates by 5%.
- Reduced reliance on external credit scores by 25% through in-house AI models.

### Tools Used

- **Python (FastAPI)**
- **scikit-learn**
- **Amazon SageMaker**
- **PowerBI** for analytics
