# MLOps Case Studies

## Financial Technology (FinTech) Fraud Detection Case Study

### Challenges

In the Fintech sector, detecting fraudulent activities in real-time is paramount. With a growing number of transactions, the existing systems struggled to maintain accuracy, leading to potential financial losses and compromised user trust.

### Solution

To combat these challenges, the company implemented a comprehensive MLOps solution. Leveraging tools like Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow), Kubernetes, Jenkins, and MLflow, they developed, deployed, and monitored a machine learning model for fraud detection. Continuous retraining pipelines ensured the model stayed accurate over time, while Kubernetes infrastructure enabled scalable, real-time deployment.

Added On-device Face Detection using ML Kit and liveness detection using OpenCV on servers to reduce fraud in applications.

Utilized graph analytics to unveil intricate fraud schemes and networks by analyzing transaction networks and user behaviors in a fintech environment.

### Results

The implementation of the MLOps solution significantly improved the accuracy of fraud detection, reducing false positives and negatives. Real-time monitoring capabilities allowed the company to swiftly respond to suspicious activities, safeguarding user accounts and minimizing financial losses. With enhanced security measures in place, the company bolstered trust among its user base and strengthened its position in the FinTech market.

- Reduced NPAs from 9% to 6%
- Reduced financial losses to a tune of around ~â‚¹2 Cr. P.M.
- Ability to quickly find fraud hot spots to quickly turn off disbursals for that pincode

### Tools Used

Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow), Kubernetes, Jenkins, MLflow

## Financial Technology (Fintech) Credit Risk Analysis and Modeling Case Study

### Challenges

In the competitive Fintech landscape, providing faster loans with favorable terms while minimizing Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) is crucial. Traditional credit risk analysis methods often result in lengthy processing times and suboptimal terms, impacting customer satisfaction and financial performance.

### Solution

To address these challenges, the company implemented a comprehensive MLOps solution for credit risk analysis and modeling. Leveraging tools like Python (scikit-learn, XGBoost), Apache Spark, AWS S3 + Athena, and MLflow, they developed and deployed machine learning models to assess credit risk efficiently. Real-time data processing capabilities enabled swift decision-making, while continuous retraining pipelines ensured models remained accurate and adaptable to evolving risk factors.

### Results

The implementation of the MLOps solution revolutionized the company's lending process, enabling faster loan approvals with improved terms and reduced NPAs. By leveraging sophisticated credit risk models, the company minimized the risk of default while offering competitive interest rates, enhancing customer satisfaction and retention. Real-time monitoring and retraining capabilities allowed the company to stay agile in response to changing market conditions, further optimizing loan portfolios and financial performance.

- Reduced NPAs from 8% to 4%
- Reduced 30+ delinquency rate by 5%
- Reduced cost for bureau credit scores by 25% by using in house models for repeat customer

## IoT Predictive Maintenance for HVAC Systems Case Study

### Challenges

In the IoT sector, managing HVAC systems efficiently is essential for reducing operational costs and ensuring customer comfort. Traditional maintenance approaches often result in reactive responses to system failures, leading to downtime, increased repair costs, and compromised reliability.

### Solution

To address these challenges, the company implemented an IoT-driven predictive maintenance solution for HVAC systems. Leveraged tools like Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, TensorFlow, and AWS IoT Core, to collect real-time data on system performance and environmental conditions on deployed sensors. Machine learning models were developed to analyze this data and predict potential failures before they occur. Automated alerts and notifications were integrated into the system to facilitate proactive maintenance actions.

### Results

The implementation of the IoT predictive maintenance solution revolutionized the management of HVAC systems, resulting in reduced operational costs, increased reliability, and enhanced customer comfort. By predicting and preemptively addressing maintenance needs, the company minimized downtime and avoided costly repairs, leading to significant savings. Real-time monitoring capabilities allowed for proactive decision-making, optimizing resource allocation and system performance. As a result, customers enjoyed uninterrupted comfort and satisfaction, further enhancing the company's reputation and competitive advantage in the market.

- Reduced equipment downtime and breakdowns by 25%
- Increased energy savings by 20%
- Increased compliance by 30%

### Tools Used
