### Smart Credit

- Health Insurance money is paid by insurer directly to hospital (smart/programmable currency)
- Whatever credit you take is directly transfered to merchant to that purpose, it doesn't go to you, so that can give credit at lesser interest rate, like car loan, home loan
- Food Coupons, other coupons

### Regenerative Finance (ReFi)

ReFi is a beautiful idea -- a re-imagining of the financial system using the tools humanity now has at its disposal to better account for the needs of all stakeholders, current and future. It puts a price on externalities, charging those who create negative externalities (like the Once-ler) and rewarding those who create positive externalities (like the Lorax, who speaks for the trees)

ReFi seems hippie, but it isn't anti-growth or anti-progress. It's not anti anything. It's for a new financial model that includes and regenerates people as individuals with unique talents, communities as economic hubs, and the health and biodiversity of global ecosystems. Its participants want to accelerate the development of new, planet-positive technologies through better measurement and financing

That idea came from Charles Eisenstein's Sacred Economics: if you back money with more of the things you want to see in the world, you'll get more of those things

Celo is based on a belief that programmable money will unlock new economic models, and that changing the features of money (which is possible because money's just a technology) can lead to a more beautiful world. And it's a bet that mission-aligned builders will care as much about a Layer 1's community as they do its tech specs. When everything is open, liquidity has no loyalty, and each blockchain's technology continues to improve, standing for something, and building a community around it, might be a key competitive advantage in a multi-chain world

- Just give request, limit, HPA enable disable, network, and apply the kubernetes manifest
- No configuration or anything else

1. Create a camera that follows its subject (in case of teaching a course settings or a conference setting).
    - It should take in focus the moving person
    - If he/she writes on blackboard then it should be focused out to see the whole blackboard or the main context of the blackboard
    - If there is a presentation, then two cameras must coordinate to capture presentation, and the other will capture the speaker
    - Advanced - Final video can be created by switching between presentation, speaker.
