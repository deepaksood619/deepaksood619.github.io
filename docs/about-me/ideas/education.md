Vision - world's best tutor democratized

The problem is how to add human intelligence to our LLM model like if you are bad at history and that is only 10% of the whole 100% marks in UPSC then LLM should decide that it should focus more on the remaining 90% rather than the 10% which you are not able to crack.

First LLM should be trained on whole UPSC syllabus and should know everything about UPSC. It should have like 1 crore column and then for each candidate one row and it should know for each candidate what he/she knows.

This whole 1 crore features now should be sent to the LLM to decide on the next plan of action. as to what should be taught today to the candidate so that he can reach the ultimate goal. Foundational things should be taught first.

It should also get when you want to give the exam. And create a plan according to that along with probability of cracking the exam displayed each day.

It should make sure you learn 8 or whatever allocated hours for that day, based on your plan.

First judge the LLM what is its current capability for cracking UPSC exam.
