An oligopoly is a [market form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_structure) where in a [market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_(economics)) or [industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_(economics)) is dominated by a small group of large sellers (oligopolists). For example, it has been found out that insulin and the electrical industry are highly oligopolist in the US.

combine digital and physical

**Attention Economy -** Apps such as Facebook, Youtube that want to increase the time spent on their app... They are generally solving for entertainment or allowing self-expression. Their north star of these apps revolves around maximizing time spent by customers on the app. Think Spotify, Netflix, PubG, Tiktok etc.

**Transactions Economy -** Apps such as Amazon, Uber or any marketplace or platform that help make purchase decisions quickly. Here time spent is vanity, they focus on utility and fulfillment by increasing the number of transactions on the platform. Think Gpay, Swiggy, or any online retail company etc

**Productivity Economy -** Apps or products such as Slack, Trello, Microsoft Office, or most SAAS software that are working hard to improve your efficiency at work. Their key goals will revolve around solving a core problem and these measure success through usage, not time spent. Think Zoho, Adobe, Evernote, etc..

- Instead,for early-stage B2B businesses, investors focus on how quickly they ramp to $1m ARR after going live

## Discovery Commerce Platform (e-commerce)

Discovery commerce is an online sales method based on guiding the buyer towards a product.

Discovery shopping, on the other hand, is where **a user visits websites or marketplaces without a defined purpose**. This buyer isn’t looking for a specific product, but is open to being pleasantly surprised by exploring an online catalog or receiving suggestions.

Discovery commerce is the equivalent of 'I'm feeling lucky' in Google searches. While the main effort of an ecommerce strategy is aimed at efficiently meeting specific needs of the consumer, discovery commerce draws on the custom of strolling through a store, browsing shelves without intention to buy... until the perfect product catches your eye.
