Traditionally, Hadoop saves its data internally in flat sequence files, which is a binary storage format for key value pairs. It has the benefit of being more compact than text and fits well the map-reduce output format. Sequence files can be compressed on value, or block level, to improve its IO profile further. Unfortunately, sequence files are not an optimal solution for Hive since it saves a complete row as a single binary value. Consequently, Hive has to read a full row and decompress it even if only one column is being requested.
