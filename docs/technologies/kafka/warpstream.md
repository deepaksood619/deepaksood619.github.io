# WarpStream

[Kafka is dead, long live Kafka](https://www.warpstream.com/blog/kafka-is-dead-long-live-kafka)

WarpStream is anÂ Apache Kafka protocol **compatible data streaming platform** built directly on top of **S3**. It's delivered as a single, stateless Go binary, so there are no local disks to manage, no brokers to rebalance, and no ZooKeeper to operate. WarpStream is 5-10x cheaper than Kafka in the cloud because data streams directly to and from S3 instead of using inter-zone networking, which can be over 80% of the infrastructure cost of a Kafka deployment at scale.
