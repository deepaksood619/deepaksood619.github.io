# Maintaining Compliance and Privacy

Throughout this course, it has been noted that certain industries are highly regulated, in particular financial services, healthcare, government, energy, and more. Typically, these industries have certain regulations or specific mandates when it comes to customer, vendor, or confidential data.

Tracking and being compliant can require a significant amount of time and effort on your part.

Here are some of the compliance and privacy regulations that Confluent Cloud provides and maintains for customers:
