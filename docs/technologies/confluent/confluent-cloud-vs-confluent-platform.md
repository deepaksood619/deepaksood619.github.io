# Confluent Cloud vs Confluent Platform

**Confluent Platform is a self-managed distribution of Apache Kafka that you control and operate, typically for on-premises or private cloud deployments, while Confluent Cloud is a fully-managed, cloud-native Kafka service that offloads all infrastructure management to Confluent**. The primary difference is the operational model: Platform offers flexibility and complete control at the cost of requiring significant operational expertise, whereas Cloud offers simplicity and scalability with a pay-as-you-go model but is managed by the provider.

| **Pricing**           | Subscription-based, often based on cluster size, users, or support                       | Pay-as-you-go, based on consumed resources like throughput, storage, and API calls                                  |
| **Control**           | Complete control and customization                                                       | Less direct control over infrastructure, but offers features like private networking and BYOK for enhanced security |
| **Ease of Use**       | Requires more technical expertise                                                        | Easier to use and manage due to automation                                                                          |
