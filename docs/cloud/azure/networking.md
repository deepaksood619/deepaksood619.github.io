## What is Azure Virtual Network?

Azure Virtual Network provides the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. This service enables Azure resources like virtual machines (VMs) to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. Virtual networks deliver the scale, availability, and isolation benefits of Azure infrastructure while maintaining the familiar networking concepts you use in traditional datacenters.
