# Amazon EBS

## EBS Usage

EBS volumes are network-attached storage that persists independently from the running life of a single EC2 instance. After an EBS volume is attached to an EC2 instance, you can use the EBS volume similar to a physical hard drive -- typically by formatting it with the file system of your choice and using the file I/O interface provided by the instance operating system. Multiple EBS volumes can be attached to a single EC2 instance and it allows you to dynamically increase capacity, tune performance, and change the type of any new or existing current generation volume with no downtime or performance impact. Furthermore EBS provides the ability to save point-in-time snapshots of your volumes. Each separate volume can be configured as EBS General Purpose (SSD), Provisioned IOPS (SSD), Throughput Optimized (HDD), or Cold (HDD) as needed

The volumes types fall into two categories:

- SSD-backed volumes optimized for transactional workloads involving frequent read/write operations with small I/O size, where the dominant performance attribute is IOPS
- HDD-backed volumes optimized for large streaming workloads where throughput (measured in MiB/s) is a better performance measure than IOPS

## Durability & availability

Amazon EBS cloud service is designed to be highly available and reliable. As mentioned earlier EBS volumes data is replicated across multiple servers within availability zones. Taking snapshots of your EBS volumes increases the durability of the data stored on your EBS volumes. Furthermore, EBS volumes are designed for anAnnual Failure Rate (AFR)of between0.1 and 0.2 percent, where failure refers to a complete or partial loss of the volume, depending on the size and performance of the volume.

## Security

IAM service enables access to EBS volumes, allowing you to specify who can access which EBS volumes. EBS encryption enables data-at-rest and data-in-motion security. It offers seamless encryption of both EBS boot volumes and data volumes as well as snapshots. Access control plus encryption offers a strong defense-in-depth security strategy for your data.

Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block-level storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances. When you create an **encrypted Amazon EBS volume** and attach it to a supported instance type, data stored at rest on the volume, data moving between the volume and the instance, snapshots created from the volume and volumes created from those snapshots are all encrypted. It uses AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master keys (CMK) when creating encrypted volumes and snapshots. Encryption operations occur on the servers that host Amazon EC2 instances, ensuring the security of both data-at-rest and data-in-transit between an instance and its attached Amazon EBS storage.

- Data at rest inside the volume is encrypted
- Data moving between the volume and the instance is encrypted
- Any snapshot created from the volume is encrypted

Multi-Attach is now available on [Amazon EBS](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/) Provisioned IOPS volume type, io2. Launched in August 2020, io2 is the newest generation of our Provisioned IOPS volume type designed for 99.999% durability (100x io1) and 500:1 IOPS:GiB (10x io1). Multi-Attach lets you share access to an EBS data volume between up to 16 Nitro-based EC2 instances within the same Availability Zone (AZ). Each attached instance has full read and write permission to the shared volume. Multi-Attach is intended to make it easier to achieve higher application availability for customers that want to deploy applications that manage storage consistency from multiple writers in shared storage infrastructure.

## Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1)

Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) is backed by solid-state drives (SSDs) and is a high-performance Amazon EBS storage option designed for critical, I/O intensive database and application workloads, as well as throughput-intensive database workloads. io1 is designed to deliver a consistent baseline performance of up to 50 IOPS/GB to a maximum of 64,000 IOPS and provide up to 1,000 MB/s of throughput per volume. Therefore, the io1 volume type would be able to meet the requirement of 25,000 IOPS per volume for the given use-case.

**General Purpose SSD (gp2) volumes** offer cost-effective storage that is ideal for a broad range of workloads. These volumes deliver single-digit millisecond latencies and the ability to burst to 3,000 IOPS for an extended duration. Between a minimum of 100 IOPS (at 33.33 GiB and below) and a maximum of 16,000 IOPS (at 5,334 GiB and above), baseline performance scales linearly at 3 IOPS per GiB of volume size. AWS designs gp2 volumes to deliver a provisioned performance of 99% uptime. A gp2 volume can range in size from 1 GiB to 16 TiB.

[Migrate your Amazon EBS volumes from gp2 to gp3 and save up to 20% on costs | AWS Storage Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/migrate-your-amazon-ebs-volumes-from-gp2-to-gp3-and-save-up-to-20-on-costs/)

- It might take up to 24 hours for a new configuration to take effect, and in some cases more, such as when the volume has not been fully initialized. Typically, a fully used 1-TiB volume takes about 6 hours to migrate to a new performance configuration. Transitional volume performance will be no less than the source volume performance. If you are downgrading IOPS, transitional volume performance is no less than the target volume performance.

- There is no downtime associated but always plan to make modifications at the time when clusters is expected to be least busy. There wouldn't be downtime, you may see "Storage Optimization" status.

## Amazon EBS Snapshot

You can back up the data on your Amazon EBS volumes to Amazon S3 by taking point-in-time snapshots. Snapshots are *incremental* backups, which means that only the blocks on the device that have changed after your most recent snapshot are saved. This minimizes the time required to create the snapshot and saves on storage costs by not duplicating data. When you delete a snapshot, only the data unique to that snapshot is removed. Each snapshot contains all of the information that is needed to restore your data (from the moment when the snapshot was taken) to a new EBS volume.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSSnapshots.html

EBS volumes provide durable block-level storage for use with EC2 instances in the AWS cloud. Volumes are automatically replicated within Availability Zones for high availability and durability.

### Amazon EBS fast snapshot restore (FSR)

Amazon EBS fast snapshot restore (FSR) enables you to create a volume from a snapshot that is fully initialized at creation. This eliminates the latency of I/O operations on a block when it is accessed for the first time. Volumes that are created using fast snapshot restore instantly deliver all of their provisioned performance.

To get started, enable fast snapshot restore for specific snapshots in specific Availability Zones. Each snapshot and Availability Zone pair refers to one fast snapshot restore. When you create a volume from one of these snapshots in one of its enabled Availability Zones, the volume is restored using fast snapshot restore.

You must explicitly enable fast snapshot restore for each snapshot. For example, if you create a new snapshot from a volume that was restored from a fast snapshot restore-enabled snapshot, the new snapshot is not automatically enabled for fast snapshot restore. If you copy a snapshot that is enabled for fast snapshot restore, the snapshot copy is not automatically enabled for fast snapshot restore.
