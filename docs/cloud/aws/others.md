## AWS CDK

The AWS CDK lets you build reliable, scalable, cost-effective applications in the cloud with the considerable expressive power of a programming language. This approach yields many benefits, including:

- Build with high-level constructs that automatically provide sensible, secure defaults for your AWS resources, defining more infrastructure with less code.
- Use programming idioms like parameters, conditionals, loops, composition, and inheritance to model your system design from building blocks provided by AWS and others.
- Put your infrastructure, application code, and configuration all in one place, ensuring that at every milestone you have a complete, cloud-deployable system.
- Employ software engineering practices such as code reviews, unit tests, and source control to make your infrastructure more robust.
- Connect your AWS resources together (even across stacks) and grant permissions using simple, intent-oriented APIs.
- Import existing AWS CloudFormation templates to give your resources a CDK API.
- Use the power of AWS CloudFormation to perform infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly, with rollback on error.
- Easily share infrastructure design patterns among teams within your organization or even with the public.
