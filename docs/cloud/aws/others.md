## AWS CDF

The AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) leverages AWS experience and best practices to help you digitally transform and accelerate your business outcomes through innovative use of AWS. AWS CAF identifies specific organizational capabilities that underpin successful cloud transformations. These capabilities provide best practice guidance that helps you improve your cloud readiness. AWS CAF groups its capabilities in six perspectives: Business, People, Governance, Platform, Security, and Operations. Each perspective comprises a set of capabilities that functionally related stakeholders own or manage in the cloud transformation journey. Use the AWS CAF to identify and prioritize transformation opportunities, evaluate and improve your cloud readiness, and iteratively evolve your transformation roadmap.

- **Envision -** The Envision phase of the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) focuses on demonstrating how the cloud will help accelerate your business outcomes.
- **Align -** The Align phase of the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) focuses on identifying capability gaps across the six AWS CAF perspectives, identifying cross-organizational dependencies, and surfacing stakeholder concerns and challenges.
- **Launch -** The Launch phase of the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) focuses on delivering pilot initiatives in production and on demonstrating incremental business value.
- **Scale -** The Scale phase of the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) focuses on expanding production pilots and business value to desired scale and ensuring that the business benefits associated with your cloud investments are realized and sustained.

## AWS CDK

The AWS CDK lets you build reliable, scalable, cost-effective applications in the cloud with the considerable expressive power of a programming language. This approach yields many benefits, including:

- Build with high-level constructs that automatically provide sensible, secure defaults for your AWS resources, defining more infrastructure with less code.
- Use programming idioms like parameters, conditionals, loops, composition, and inheritance to model your system design from building blocks provided by AWS and others.
- Put your infrastructure, application code, and configuration all in one place, ensuring that at every milestone you have a complete, cloud-deployable system.
- Employ software engineering practices such as code reviews, unit tests, and source control to make your infrastructure more robust.
- Connect your AWS resources together (even across stacks) and grant permissions using simple, intent-oriented APIs.
- Import existing AWS CloudFormation templates to give your resources a CDK API.
- Use the power of AWS CloudFormation to perform infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly, with rollback on error.
- Easily share infrastructure design patterns among teams within your organization or even with the public.
