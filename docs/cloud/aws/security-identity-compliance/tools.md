## Security Hub vs Audit Manager

For small organizations with not a lot of assets and findings that Security Hub on its own is probably sufficient. For larger organizations or those that have lots of assets and finding, Audit Manager can be extremely helpful on cutting down the noise of everything else and helping your or your external auditors focus on their task at hand.

## ScoutSuite

Scout Suite is an open source multi-cloud security-auditing tool, which enables security posture assessment of cloud environments. Using the APIs exposed by cloud providers, Scout Suite gathers configuration data for manual inspection and highlights risk areas. Rather than going through dozens of pages on the web consoles, Scout Suite presents a clear view of the attack surface automatically.

The following cloud providers are currently supported/planned:

- Amazon Web Services
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud Platform
- Alibaba Cloud (alpha)
- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (alpha)

## Terrascan

Detect compliance and security violations across Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to mitigate risk before provisioning cloud native infrastructure.

Policy as Code for Secure Cloud Infrastructure

As you embrace Infrastructure as Code (IaC) such as [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [Atlantis](https://www.runatlantis.io/) and AWS CloudFormation, it is important to ensure that security best practices and compliance requirements are observed. Terrascan provides 500+ out-of-the-box policies so that you can scan IaC against common policy standards such as the CIS Benchmark. It leverages the [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) (OPA) engine so that you can easily create custom policies using the Rego query language.
