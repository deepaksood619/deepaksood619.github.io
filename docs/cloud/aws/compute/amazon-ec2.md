## EC2 > Networking > Elastic IP Addresses

An Elastic IP address is a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. An Elastic IP address is associated with your AWS account. With an Elastic IP address, you can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your account.

An Elastic IP address is a public IPv4 address, which is reachable from the internet. If your instance does not have a public IPv4 address, you can associate an Elastic IP address with your instance to enable communication with the internet; for example, to connect to your instance from your local computer.

- Limited to five Elastic IP addresses per account

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-eips.html

[AWS supports dynamically removing and adding auto assigned public IPv4 address](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/04/removing-adding-auto-assigned-public-ipv4-address/)

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html

### Elastic IP address pricing

There is a charge for all Elastic IP addresses whether they are in use (allocated to a resource, like an EC2 instance) or idle (created in your account but unallocated).

AWS charges for all public IPv4 addresses, including public IPv4 addresses associated with running instances and Elastic IP addresses. For more information, see the **Public IPv4 Address** tab on the [Amazon VPC pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/pricing/).

### Elastic IP address basics

The following are the basic characteristics of an Elastic IP address:

- An Elastic IP address is static; it does not change over time.

- An Elastic IP address is for use in a specific Region only, and cannot be moved to a different Region.

- An Elastic IP address comes from Amazon's pool of IPv4 addresses, or from a custom IPv4 address pool that you have brought to your AWS account. We do not support Elastic IP addresses for IPv6.

- To use an Elastic IP address, you first allocate one to your account, and then associate it with your instance or a network interface.

- When you associate an Elastic IP address with an instance, it is also associated with the instance's primary network interface. When you associate an Elastic IP address with a network interface that is attached to an instance, it is also associated with the instance.

- When you associate an Elastic IP address with an instance or its primary network interface, if the instance already has a public IPv4 address associated with it, that public IPv4 address is released back into Amazon's pool of public IPv4 addresses and the Elastic IP address is associated with the instance instead. You cannot reuse the public IPv4 address previously associated with the instance and you cannot convert that public IPv4 address to an Elastic IP address. For more information, see [Public IPv4 addresses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#concepts-public-addresses).

- You can disassociate an Elastic IP address from a resource, and then associate it with a different resource. To avoid unexpected behavior, ensure that all active connections to the resource named in the existing association are closed before you make the change. After you have associated your Elastic IP address to a different resource, you can reopen your connections to the newly associated resource.

- A disassociated Elastic IP address remains allocated to your account until you explicitly release it. You are charged for all Elastic IP addresses in your account, regardless of whether they are associated or disassociated with an instance. For more information, see the **Public IPv4 Address** tab on the [Amazon VPC pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/pricing/) page.

- When you associate an Elastic IP address with an instance that previously had a public IPv4 address, the public DNS host name of the instance changes to match the Elastic IP address.

- We resolve a public DNS host name to the public IPv4 address or the Elastic IP address of the instance outside the network of the instance, and to the private IPv4 address of the instance from within the network of the instance.

- When you allocate an Elastic IP address from an IP address pool that you have brought to your AWS account, it does not count toward your Elastic IP address limits. For more information, see [Elastic IP address quota](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html#using-instance-addressing-limit).

- When you allocate the Elastic IP addresses, you can associate the Elastic IP addresses with a network border group. This is the location from which we advertise the CIDR block. Setting the network border group limits the CIDR block to this group. If you do not specify the network border group, we set the border group containing all of the Availability Zones in the Region (for example, `us-west-2`).

- An Elastic IP address is for use in a specific network border group only.

### Changes (Migrate from ipv4 to ipv6)

Effective February 1, 2024 there will be a charge of $0.005 per IP per hour for all public IPv4 addresses, whether attached to a service or not (there is already a charge for public IPv4 addresses you allocate in your account but don’t attach to an EC2 instance).

This will cost around $4 month per IP per month

## EC2 > Networking > ENI

An elastic network interface (referred to as a*network interface*in this documentation) is a logical networking component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html

## EC2 Launch Templates

A launch template specifies instance configuration information. It includes the ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), the instance type, a key pair, security groups, and other parameters used to launch EC2 instances. If you've launched an EC2 instance before, you specified the same information to launch the instance.

When you create a Launch Template, the default value for the instance tenancy is shared and the instance tenancy is controlled by the tenancy attribute of the VPC. If you set the Launch Template Tenancy to shared (default) and the VPC Tenancy is set to dedicated, then the instances have dedicated tenancy. If you set the Launch Template Tenancy to dedicated and the VPC Tenancy is set to default, then again the instances have dedicated tenancy.

[Create an Amazon EC2 launch template - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/create-launch-template.html)

## Placement groups for your Amazon EC2 instances

To meet the needs of your workload, you can launch a group of *interdependent* EC2 instances into a *placement group* to influence their placement.

Depending on the type of workload, you can create a placement group using one of the following placement strategies:

- **Cluster** – Packs instances close together inside an Availability Zone. This strategy enables workloads to achieve the low-latency network performance necessary for tightly-coupled node-to-node communication that is typical of high-performance computing (HPC) applications.
- **Partition** – Spreads your instances across logical partitions such that groups of instances in one partition do not share the underlying hardware with groups of instances in different partitions. This strategy is typically used by large distributed and replicated workloads, such as Hadoop, Cassandra, and Kafka.
- **Spread** – Strictly places a small group of instances across distinct underlying hardware to reduce correlated failures.

Placement groups are optional. If you don't launch your instances into a placement group, EC2 tries to place the instances in such a way that all of your instances are spread out across the underlying hardware to minimize correlated failures.

### Pricing

There is no charge for creating a placement group.

### Rules and limitations

Before you use placement groups, be aware of the following rules:

- An instance can be placed in one placement group at a time; you can't place an instance in multiple placement groups.
- You can't merge placement groups.
- [On-Demand Capacity Reservations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-capacity-reservations.html#capacity-reservations-limits) and [zonal Reserved Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/reserved-instances-scope.html) allow you to reserve capacity for EC2 instances in Availability Zones. When you launch an instance, if the instance attributes match those specified by an On-Demand Capacity Reservation or a zonal Reserved Instance, then the reserved capacity is automatically used by the instance. This is also true if you launch the instance into a placement group.
- You can't launch Dedicated Hosts in placement groups.
- You can't launch a Spot Instance that is configured to stop or hibernate on interruption in a placement group.

## EC2 Instance metadata and user data

### Instance Metadata

**Instance metadata is data about your instance that you can use to configure or manage the running instance.** Instance metadata is divided into [categories](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-categories.html), for example, host name, events, and security groups.

EC2 instance metadata is a service accessible from within EC2 instances, which allows querying or managing data about a given running instance.

It is possible to retrieve an instance’s IAM access key by accessing the `iam/security-credentials/role-name` metadata category. This returns a temporary set of credentials that the EC2 instance automatically uses for communicating with AWS services.

[Instance metadata and user data - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html)

### User Data

User Data is generally used to perform common automated configuration tasks and even run scripts after the instance starts. When you launch an instance in Amazon EC2, you can pass two types of user data - shell scripts and cloud-init directives. You can also pass this data into the launch wizard as plain text or as a file.

**Scripts entered as user data are executed as the root user**, hence do not need the sudo command in the script. Any files you create will be owned by root; if you need non-root users to have file access, you should modify the permissions accordingly in the script.

By default, user data scripts and cloud-init directives run only **during the boot cycle when you first launch an instance**. You can update your configuration to ensure that your user data scripts and cloud-init directives run every time you restart your instance.

## Amazon Machine Images (AMI / AMIs)

It is used as a provisioning system, to provision a new instance with an image of the instance.

An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an instance, which is a virtual server in the cloud. You must specify a source AMI when you launch an instance. You can launch multiple instances from a single AMI when you need multiple instances with the same configuration. You can use different AMIs to launch instances when you need instances with different configurations.

An AMI includes the following:

- A template for the root volume for the instance (for example, an operating system, an application server, and applications)
- Launch permissions that control which AWS accounts can use the AMI to launch instances
- A block device mapping that specifies the volumes to attach to the instance when it's launched

**AMIs (Amazon Machine Images) are region-specific;** an AMI that exists in one AWS region cannot be used directly in another region, and each region has a unique AMI ID for similar images. However, users can copy AMIs across regions to make them available for global deployment.

Launch permissions that control which AWS accounts can use the AMI to launch instances.

A block device mapping that specifies the volumes to attach to the instance when it's launched.

You can copy an AMI within or across AWS Regions using the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface or SDKs, or the Amazon EC2 API, all of which support the CopyImage action. You can copy both Amazon EBS-backed AMIs and instance-store-backed AMIs. You can copy AMIs with encrypted snapshots and also change encryption status during the copy process.

You can share an AMI with another AWS account. To copy an AMI that was shared with you from another account, the owner of the source AMI must grant you read permissions for the storage that backs the AMI, either the associated Amazon EBS snapshot (for an Amazon EBS-backed AMI) or an associated S3 bucket (for an instance store-backed AMI).

### Standard AMIs

## Recovery

If your instance fails a system status check, you can use Amazon CloudWatch alarm actions to automatically recover it. The recover option is available for over 90% of deployed customer Amazon EC2 instances. The Amazon CloudWatch recovery option works only for system check failures, not for instance status check failures. Also, if you terminate your instance, then it can't be recovered.

You can create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that monitors an Amazon EC2 instance and automatically recovers the instance if it becomes impaired due to an underlying hardware failure or a problem that requires AWS involvement to repair. Terminated instances cannot be recovered. A recovered instance is identical to the original instance, including the instance ID, private IP addresses, Elastic IP addresses, and all instance metadata. If the impaired instance is in a placement group, the recovered instance runs in the placement group.

The automatic recovery process attempts to recover your instance for up to three separate failures per day. Your instance may subsequently be retired if automatic recovery fails and a hardware degradation is determined to be the root cause for the original system status check failure.

- A recovered instance is identical to the original instance, including the instance ID, private IP addresses, Elastic IP addresses, and all instance metadata
- If your instance has a public IPv4 address, it retains the public IPv4 address after recovery.
- If the impaired instance is in a placement group, the recovered instance runs in the same placement group.
- Terminated instances cannot be recovered
- During instance recovery, the instance is migrated during an instance reboot, and any data that is in-memory is lost.
