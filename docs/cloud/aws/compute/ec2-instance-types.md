## Differences Between Intel, AMD, and Graviton

Intel, AMD, and Graviton each come with tradeoffs:

- **CPU Architecture:** Intel and AMD have x86-based architecture, while Graviton has 64-bit Arm Neoverse cores. The architecture affects software compatibility and performance. Arm-based architecture, in particular, has potential compatibility issues with certain software that may not be supported or may require refactoring. A common reason in the past not to use Graviton was vendor lock-in, as Arm is not as widely supported, which is still true, however, [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-virtual-machines-with-ampere-altra-arm-based-processors-generally-available/) and [Google](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/introducing-googles-new-arm-based-cpu) (as of this month) both now have Arm processors available.

- **Threading:** Intel and AMD support [simultaneous multithreading](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-optimize-cpu.html), enabling “multiple threads to run concurrently on a single CPU core.” Graviton, on the other hand, does not, and [every vCPU is a physical core](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-graviton2-for-isv/optimizing-for-performance.html). Some workloads, like data analytics, are more efficient on a multithreaded workload, whereas others, such as gaming, perform better on single-threaded workloads. Note—you can [disable multithreading](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-specify-cpu-options.html) by setting one thread per code.

- **Price Performance:** Graviton is advertised by AWS to have [better price performance](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/), in some cases up to 40%, than comparable Intel and AMD instances. Independent benchmarks comparing similar instances, such as [this one by Scylla](https://www.scylladb.com/2021/09/16/aws-graviton2-arm-brings-better-price-performance-than-intel/), also find Graviton to be more price-performant. This is due in part to Arm-based processors having lower power consumption and more competitive margins since Graviton is owned by Amazon. Graviton is an excellent choice for those who are prioritizing cost.

- **Performance:** Benchmarks show various results since performance is so specific to use cases. As such, if you’re choosing between instances, consider running your workload on different instances to compare.

## EC2

### EC2 Instance metadata and user data

_Instance metadata_ is data about your instance that you can use to configure or manage the running instance. Instance metadata is divided into [categories](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-categories.html), for example, host name, events, and security groups.

EC2 instance metadata is a service accessible from within EC2 instances, which allows querying or managing data about a given running instance.

It is possible to retrieve an instance’s IAM access key by accessing the `iam/security-credentials/role-name` metadata category. This returns a temporary set of credentials that the EC2 instance automatically uses for communicating with AWS services.

## Bottlerocket

Bottlerocket is a Linux-based open-source operating system that is purpose-built by Amazon Web Services for running containers on virtual machines or bare metal hosts. Most customers today run containerized applications on general-purpose operating systems that are updated package-by-package, which makes OS updates difficult to automate. Updates to Bottlerocket are applied in a single step rather than package-by-package. This single-step update process helps reduce management overhead by making OS updates easy to automate using container orchestration services such as Amazon EKS. The single-step updates also improve uptime for container applications by minimizing update failures and enabling easy update rollbacks. Additionally, Bottlerocket includes only the essential software to run containers, which improves resource usage and reduces the attack surface.
