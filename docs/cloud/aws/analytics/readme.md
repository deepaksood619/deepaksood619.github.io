## Amazon EMR

Hosted Hadoop Framework

Easily Run and Scale Apache Spark, Hadoop, HBase, Presto, Hive, and other Big Data Frameworks

Amazon EMR is the industry leading cloud-native big data platform for processing vast amounts of data quickly and cost-effectively at scale. Using open source tools such as [Apache Spark](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/features/spark/), [Apache Hive](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/features/hive/), [Apache HBase](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/features/hbase/), [Apache Flink](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/use-apache-flink-on-amazon-emr/), [Apache Hudi (Incubating)](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/features/hudi/), and [Presto](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/features/presto/), coupled with the dynamic scalability of [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) and scalable storage of [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), EMR gives analytical teams the engines and elasticity to run Petabyte-scale analysis for a fraction of the cost of traditional on-premises clusters. EMR gives teams the flexibility to run use cases on single-purpose, short lived clusters that automatically scale to meet demand, or on long running highly available clusters using the new multi-master deployment mode. If you have existing on-premises deployments of open source tools such as Apache Spark and Apache Hive, you can also run [EMR clusters on AWS Outposts](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/features/outposts/), giving you both the ability to scale out on-premises via Outposts or in the cloud.

Amazon EMR makes it simple and cost effective to run highly distributed processing frameworks such as Hadoop, Spark, and Presto when compared to on-premises deployments. Amazon EMR is flexible – you can run custom applications and code, and define specific compute, memory, storage, and application parameters to optimize your analytic requirements.

In addition to running SQL queries, Amazon EMR can run a wide variety of scale-out data processing tasks for applications such as machine learning, graph analytics, data transformation, streaming data, and virtually anything you can code. You should use Amazon EMR if you use custom code to process and analyze extremely large datasets with the latest big data processing frameworks such as Spark, Hadoop, Presto, or Hbase. Amazon EMR gives you full control over the configuration of your clusters and the software installed on them.

You can use Amazon Athena to query data that you process using Amazon EMR. Amazon Athena supports many of the same data formats as Amazon EMR. Athena's data catalog is Hive metastore compatible. If you use EMR and already have a Hive metastore, you can run your DDL statements on Amazon Athena and query your data immediately without affecting your Amazon EMR jobs.

### Amazon EMR WAL

Apache HBase Write Ahead Log allows recording all changes to data to file-based storage. With Amazon EMR on EC2, you can write your Apache HBase write-ahead logs to the Amazon EMR WAL, a durable managed storage layer that outlives your cluster. In the event that your cluster, or in the rare cases that the Availability Zone becomes unhealthy or unavailable, you can create a new cluster, point it to the same Amazon S3 root directory and Amazon EMR WAL workspace, and automatically recover the data in WAL within a few minutes.

### Node Types

#### Primary node

The primary node manages the cluster and typically runs primary components of distributed applications. For example, the primary node runs the YARN ResourceManager service to manage resources for applications. It also runs the HDFS NameNode service, tracks the status of jobs submitted to the cluster, and monitors the health of the instance groups.

#### Core nodes

Core nodes are managed by the primary node. Core nodes run the Data Node daemon to coordinate data storage as part of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). They also run the Task Tracker daemon and perform other parallel computation tasks on data that installed applications require. For example, a core node runs YARN NodeManager daemons, Hadoop MapReduce tasks, and Spark executors.

#### Task nodes

You can use task nodes to add power to perform parallel computation tasks on data, such as Hadoop MapReduce tasks and Spark executors. Task nodes don't run the Data Node daemon, nor do they store data in HDFS. As with core nodes, you can add task nodes to a cluster by adding Amazon EC2 instances to an existing uniform instance group or by modifying target capacities for a task instance fleet.

## AWS Lake Formation - Build a secure data lake in days

AWS Lake Formation is a service that makes it easy to set up a secure data lake in days. A data lake is a centralized, curated, and secured repository that stores all your data, both in its original form and prepared for analysis. A data lake enables you to break down data silos and combine different types of analytics to gain insights and guide better business decisions.

However, setting up and managing data lakes today involves a lot of manual, complicated, and time-consuming tasks. This work includes loading data from diverse sources, monitoring those data flows, setting up partitions, turning on encryption and managing keys, defining transformation jobs and monitoring their operation, re-organizing data into a columnar format, configuring access control settings, deduplicating redundant data, matching linked records, granting access to data sets, and auditing access over time.

Creating a data lake with Lake Formation is as simple as defining data sources and what data access and security policies you want to apply. Lake Formation then helps you collect and catalog data from databases and object storage, move the data into your new [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) data lake, clean and classify your data using machine learning algorithms, and secure access to your sensitive data. Your users can access a centralized [data catalog](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/faqs/#AWS_Glue_Data_Catalog/) which describes available data sets and their appropriate usage. Your users then leverage these data sets with their choice of analytics and machine learning services, like [Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/), [Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/), and (in beta)[Amazon EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/) for Apache Spark. Lake Formation builds on the capabilities available in [AWS Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/).
