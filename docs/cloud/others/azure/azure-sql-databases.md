### Deployment models

Azure SQL Database provides the three deployment options:

1. **Single** is a fully managed, isolated database
2. **Elastic Pool** is a collection of single databases with a shared set of resources
3. **Managed Instance** is a fully managed instance of the SQL Server

### SQL Database Server vs SQL Database

Database Server act as a central administrative point for **multiple single** or **pooled databases**, logins, firewall rules, auditing rules, threat detection policies, and failover groups.
