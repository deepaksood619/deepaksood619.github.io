## Pricing

### CLOUDFLARE

Cloudflare pricing and review of the costs include the following:

- 0 to 200 USD for 250GB because CloudFlare does not charge on bandwidth; the three central plans prepared (including the free plan) all have various parameters depending on various features other than the bandwidth.

### AKAMAI

We are sorry to say but Akamai’s pricing isn’t available without request. Akamai does not display their pricing openly; you require reaching the company to receive a quote. However, this CDN service is more expensive than others with prices going up to 3500 USD for 1 TB.

### CLOUDFRONT

It is difficult to say who wins in CloudFlare vs CloudFront on the pricing front. Amazon CloudFront provides different plans for different content sizes:

- 24 USD for 250 GB
- 48 USD for 500 GB
- 96 USD for 1 TB
- 480 USD for 5 TB
- 888 USD for 10 TB
