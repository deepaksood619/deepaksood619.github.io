# MDM (Mobile Device Management)

Mobile device management (MDM) is a proven methodology and toolset used to provide a workforce mobile productivity tools and applications while keeping corporate data secure.

**Mobile device management** (**MDM**) is the administration of [mobile devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device "Mobile device"), such as [smartphones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone "Smartphone"), [tablet computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer "Tablet computer"), and [laptops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop "Laptop"). MDM is usually implemented with the use of a third-party product that has management features for particular [vendors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor "Vendor") of mobile devices. Though closely related to [Enterprise Mobility Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_Mobility_Management "Enterprise Mobility Management") and [Unified Endpoint Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Endpoint_Management "Unified Endpoint Management"), MDM differs slightly from both: unlike MDM, EMM includes mobile information management, [BYOD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_your_own_device "Bring your own device"), [mobile application management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_application_management "Mobile application management") and [mobile content management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_content_management_system "Mobile content management system"), whereas [UEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_endpoint_management "Unified endpoint management") provides device management for endpoints like desktops, printers, [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things "Internet of things") devices, and wearables as well.
