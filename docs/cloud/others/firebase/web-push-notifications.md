To rest assured that your customers are, in fact, engaging well with your web push notifications and performing the desired actions, you need to first optimize your opt-in for maximum conversions. Make sure your opt-in copy is personalized and compelling and highlights your value proposition to make customers want to stay updated with your offerings.
