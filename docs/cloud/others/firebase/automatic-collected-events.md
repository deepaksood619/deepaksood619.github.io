# Automatic Collected Events

Automatically collected events are triggered by basic interactions with your app. As long as you use the Firebase SDK, you don't need to write any additional code to collect these events.

Analytics collects these events for Android and iOS apps unless otherwise stated.

The following parameters are collected by default with every event, including [custom events you implement yourself](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/app-web/tag-guide):

- language
- page_location
- page_referrer
- page_title
- screen_resolution
