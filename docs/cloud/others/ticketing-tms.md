## Customer Self Service Portal / Self Service Strategy / Knowledgebase / Knowledge base

A self-service strategy is a multi-pronged approach to solving customer issues. Remember that not everyone learns the same way, so you need to set up several routes for customers to find their answers. That may involve having visuals and videos, AI chatbots, or CRM integration. Talk to your customer service reps about how to develop the [best content for your knowledge base](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203664076-Best-practices-Developing-content-for-your-knowledge-base) and FAQ sections, and build a strategy from there.

## What can you do to make your self-service customers know you value them?

The best thing you can do is make the process of self service easy and fast. Making the entire process painless, from asking the question to getting an answer, proves that you value their time and sanity as much as your own.

## What are some disadvantages of customer self service?

The only disadvantages of customer self service software come from how you use it. If you lean too much on customer self service and pull back from person-to-person support, you risk frustrating those customers who appreciate a more personal touch.

## How to handle support tickets

1. Get details on the case

2. Set status
    - Open

When a new ticket is created in the ticketing system, it gets an "Open" status. Tickets with an "Open" status should be answered as soon as possible. This status means that no agent has yet addressed the customer's case, and they're still waiting for your response. Respond to the customer to let them know that you're on your way to take care of their case.

- Pending

When you respond to an open ticket, its status will automatically change to "Pending." Tickets get a "Pending" status whenever you're waiting for a response from a customer or additional input or information so that you can proceed. If the customer responds, the ticket will go back to "Open" status.

- On hold

A ticket with an "On hold" status is a case that cannot be completed right away. This means that the customer service agent needs to consult with someone on the team or another department about the issue. Select the "On hold" status to ensure you get back to the customer when you have the answer and the best solution.

- Solved

Mark a ticket as "Solved" when you're 100% sure that you've provided the customer with the necessary answers and left them satisfied with the outcome of the conversation. After that, move on because many other cases need to end up with this status in your ticketing software.

- Closed

There can be times when someone sends you a collaboration proposal or a message with information that isn't a question or challenge for your team. You can briefly reply to such requests, and then mark them as "Closed." This way, the issue has been resolved, and you won't send an [automated feedback request](https://www.helpdesk.com/help/automated-workflows/) again.

- Spam

The "Spam" status is reserved for malicious or other unnecessary messages you don't need to deal with.

3. Set the priority
    - Urgent
    - High
    - Medium
    - Low

6. Choose the right agent

7. Add other people involved in the case
