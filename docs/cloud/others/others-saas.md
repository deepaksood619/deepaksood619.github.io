Automatically add new Google Workspace users to a specific group. This ensures that every new user created in your organization is automatically included in the group.

1. **Sign in to your Google Admin console:** This requires administrator privileges.
2. **Navigate to the Group you want to manage:** Go to Menu > Directory > Groups and select the group.
3. **Add members:** Click on "Add members" within the group settings.
4. **Select Advanced:** Click on the "Advanced" option.
5. **Add all users:** Check the box that says "Add all current and future users of our organization to the group with all email settings".
6. **Confirm:** Click "Add to Group".

### Plus Addressing

Gmail's "plus addressing" feature **lets you create multiple email address variations within your main account without needing new accounts or aliases**. You can simply append a "+" and any characters to your username before the "@gmail.com" address, and Gmail will deliver all emails to your inbox. This is useful for organizing, tracking, and filtering emails.

Here's how it works:

- **Basic Format:** If your email is `username@gmail.com`, you can use variations like `username+friends@gmail.com` or `username+work@gmail.com`.
- **No Separate Accounts:** All these variations will still deliver to your main inbox.
- **Organizing and Filtering:** You can then use Gmail's filters to automatically sort or label emails based on these plus addresses.
- **Tracking Sources:** This also helps you track which websites or services you're receiving emails from, as you can easily identify the source by the plus address.
- **Privacy and Security:** Plus addressing can also help protect your privacy by creating disposable addresses for specific purposes.

#### Examples

- `john.doe+netflix@gmail.com` for signing up for a Netflix account.
- `jane.doe+subscriptions@gmail.com` for tracking recurring subscriptions.
- `user+newsletter@gmail.com` for signing up for a newsletter.

### Gmail Dot Trick

Dots don't matter in Gmail addresses

If someone accidentally adds dots to your address when emailing you, you'll still get that email. For example, if your email is johnsmith@gmail.com, you own all dotted versions of your address:

- john.smith@gmail.com
- jo.hn.sm.ith@gmail.com
- j.o.h.n.s.m.i.t.h@gmail.com

**Note:** If you use Gmail through work, school, or other organization (like yourdomain.com or yourschool.edu), dots do change your address. To change the dots in your username, contact your [admin](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6208960).
