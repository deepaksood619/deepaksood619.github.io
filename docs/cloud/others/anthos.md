# Anthos

Google has built Anthos (formerly known as Cloud Services Platform or CSP) to accelerate application modernization for SaaS providers, developers, IT operators and their end users. In order to balance developer agility, operational efficiency and platform governance, the Anthos framework enables decoupling across critical components:

- Infrastructure is decoupled from the applications (via containers and Kubernetes)
- Teams are decoupled from each other (via Kubernetes pods and services)
- Development is decoupled from operations (via service and policy management)
- Security is decoupled from development and operations (via structured policy management)
