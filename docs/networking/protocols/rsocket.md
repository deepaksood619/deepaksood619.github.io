# Rsocket

RSocket is a binary protocol for use on byte stream transports such as TCP, WebSockets, and Aeron.
It enables the following symmetric interaction models via async message passing over a single connection:

- request/response (stream of 1)
- request/stream (finite stream of many)
- fire-and-forget (no response)
- channel (bi-directional streams)
It supports session resumption, to allow resuming long-lived streams across different transport connections. This is particularly useful for mobileâ¬„server communication when network connections drop, switch, and reconnect frequently.
RSocketis an application protocol initially developed by [Netflix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix), that supports [Reactive Streams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_Streams). The motivation behind its development was to replace hypertext transfer protocol [(HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP)), which is inefficient for many tasks such as [microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservice) communication, with a protocol that has less overhead.
