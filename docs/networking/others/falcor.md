# Falcor

A JavaScript library for efficient data fetching

1. One Model Everywhere

    Falcor lets you represent all your remote data sources as a single domain model via a virtual JSON graph. You code the same way no matter where the data is, whether in memory on the client or over the network on the server.

2. The Data is the API

    A JavaScript-like path syntax makes it easy to access as much or as little data as you want, when you want it. You retrieve your data using familiar JavaScript operations like get, set, and call. If you know your data, you know your API.

3. Bind to the Cloud

    Falcor automatically traverses references in your graph and makes requests as needed. Falcor transparently handles all network communications, opportunistically batching and de-duping requests.
