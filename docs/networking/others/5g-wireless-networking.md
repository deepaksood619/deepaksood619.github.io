# 5G Wireless Networking

## Wireless Network Design

- Rethinking cellular system design
- Software-defined wireless networking

## PHY/MAC Techniques

- Utilizing more spectrum (mmWave/THz)
- (Massive) MIMO
- New modulation, coding, and detection
- New MAC strategies

## ML in Wireless Systems

## We have shown that ML "trumps theory"

- In equalization of unknown/complex channels
- In joint source and channel coding of text

## Application of ML to wireless system design

- Detection in unknown channels (molecular, mmW, nonlinear)
- Modulation and detection
- Encoding and decoding
- MIMO transmission and reception
- Joint source and channel encoding/decoding
- Network resource allocation

## ML algorithm and training optimization needed

- That is where comm/network theory come in

## Rethinking Cellular System Design

## Cellular systems reuse channels/timeslots in different cells

Traditional design assumes system is "interference-limited"

Capacity unknown; upper bound based on BC/MAC with pooled antennas

## No longer the case with recent technology advances

MIMO, multiuser detection, cooperating BSs (CoMP) and relays

Raises interesting questions such as "what is a cell?"

## Dynamic self-organizing networking (SoN) needed for optimization

## Small cells are the solution to increasing cellular system capacity

- Cellular networks are increasingly hierarchical
- Large cells for coverage
- Small cells for capacity and power efficiency
- Cell resource optimization is best done in the cloud

## Software Defined Wireless Networking

## Drastic energy reduction needed for IoT devices

1. New Infrastuctures: cell size, BS placement, DAS, Picos, relays

2. New Protocols: Cell Zooming, Coop MIMO, RRM, Scheduling, Sleeping, Relaying

3. Low-Power (Green) Radios: Radio Architectures, Modulation, coding, MIMO

## Where should energy come from?

## Batteries and traditional charging mechanisms

Well-understood devices and systems

## Wireless-power transfer

Poorly understood, especially at large distances and with high efficiency

## Communication with Energy Harvesting Devices

Intermittent and random energy arrivals

Communication becomes energy-dependent

Can combine information and energy transmission

New principles for communication system design needed
