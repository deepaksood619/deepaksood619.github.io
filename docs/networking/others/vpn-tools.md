# VPN Tools

## Openvpn

OpenVPN is a [free and open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source) software application that implements [virtual private network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network)(VPN) techniques to create secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections in routed or bridged configurations and remote access facilities. It uses a custom security protocolthat utilizes [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) for key exchange. It is capable of traversing [network address translators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translator)(NATs) and [firewalls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing))

OpenVPN allows [peers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) to [authenticate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication) each other using [pre-shared secret keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-shared_key), [certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate) or [username](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_(computing))/[password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password). When used in a multiclient-server configuration, it allows the server to release an [authentication certificate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate) for every client, using [signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature) and [certificate authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority). It uses the [OpenSSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSL) encryption [library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)) extensively, as well as the [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) protocol, and contains many security and control features.

## WireGuard

WireGuard is a novel VPN that runs inside the Linux Kernel and utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPsec, while avoiding the massive headache. It intends to be considerably more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances. It runs over UDP.
