PCEP™ – Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer certification shows that the individual is familiar with universal computer programming concepts like data types, containers, functions, conditions, loops, as well as Python programming language syntax, semantics, and the runtime environment.

The PCEP™ certification shows that the individual is familiar with the following concepts: 
1. fundamental **terms and definitions** (e.g. compilation vs. interpretation)
2. Python's **logic and structure** (e.g. keywords, instructions, indentation)
3. **literals**, **variables**, and **numeral systems**
4. **operators** and **data types**
5. **I/O operations**
6. **control flow** mechanisms (conditional blocks and loops)
7. **data collections** (lists, tuples, dictionaries, strings)
8. **functions** (decomposition, built-in and user-defined functions, organizing interaction between functions and their environment, generators, recursion)
9. **exceptions** (exception handling, hierarchies)
