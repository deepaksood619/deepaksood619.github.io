## Offline Deployment

The model is deployed to an offline container and run in a Spark job to generate batch predictions either on demand or on a repeating schedule.

## Online Deployment

The model is deployed to an online prediction service cluster (generally containing hundreds of machines behind a load balancer) where clients can send individual or batched prediction requests as network RPC calls.

## MLOps

MLOps is an engineering discipline that aims to unify ML systems development (dev) and ML systems deployment (ops) in order to standardize and streamline the continuous delivery of high-performing models in production.

### ML Lifecycle

- Framing ML problems from business goals
- Access, prepare and process data for the model
- Architect ML solution and develop ML models
- Deploy ML models
- Iterate - Monitor, optimize and maintain the performance of the model
