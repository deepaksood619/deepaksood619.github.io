## Offline Deployment

The model is deployed to an offline container and run in a Spark job to generate batch predictions either on demand or on a repeating schedule.

## Online Deployment

The model is deployed to an online prediction service cluster (generally containing hundreds of machines behind a load balancer) where clients can send individual or batched prediction requests as network RPC calls.

## ML Lifecycle

- Framing ML problems from business goals
- Access, prepare and process data for the model
- Architect ML solution and develop ML models
- Deploy ML models
- Iterate - Monitor, optimize and maintain the performance of the model
