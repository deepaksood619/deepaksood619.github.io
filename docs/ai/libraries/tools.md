# Tools

## AutoML (Automated Machine Learning)

[AutoML](https://www.smarten.com/autoInsights.html) is, quite simply, the automated process of features and algorithm selection that supports planning, and allows users to fine tune, perform iterative modeling, and allows for the application and evolution of machine learning models.

## MLflow (An open source platform for the machine learning lifecycle)

- MLflow Tracking - Record and query experiments: code, data, config, and results.
- MLflow Projects - Packaging format for reproducible runs on any platform.
- MLflow Models - General format for sending models to diverse deployment tools.

## LIME

Explaining the predictions of any machine learning classifier

LIME is model-agnostic, meaning that it can be applied to any machine learning model. The technique attempts to understand the model by perturbing the input of data samples and understanding how the predictions change.

## Facets

Open Source Visualization Tool

- Facets Overview

Facets Overview automatically gives users a quick understanding of the distribution of values across the features of their datasets. Multiple datasets, such as a training set and a test set, can be compared on the same visualization. Common data issues that can hamper machine learning are pushed to the forefront, such as: unexpected feature values, features with high percentages of missing values, features with unbalanced distributions, and feature distribution skew between datasets.

- Facets Dive

Facets Dive provides an easy-to-customize, intuitive interface for exploring the relationship between the data points across the different features of a dataset. With Facets Dive, you control the position, color and visual representation of each data point based on its feature values. If the data points have images associated with them, the images can be used as the visual representations.

## HOPS

Hops(HadoopOpenPlatform-as-a-Service) is a next generation distribution of [Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/core/) with scalable, highly available, customizable metadata. Hops consists internally of two main sub projects, HopsFs and HopsYarn.HopsFSis a new implementation of the Hadoop Filesystem (HDFS), that supports multiple stateless NameNodes, where the metadata is stored in [MySQL Cluster](https://www.mysql.com/products/cluster/), an in-memory distributed database. HopsFS enables more scalable clusters than Apache HDFS (up to ten times larger clusters), and enables NameNode metadata to be both customized and analyzed, because it can now be easily accessed via a SQL API.HopsYARNintroduces a distributed stateless Resource Manager, whose state is migrated to MySQL Cluster. This enables our YARN architecture to have no down-time, with failover of a ResourceManager happening in a few seconds. Together, HopsFS and HopsYARN enable Hadoop clusters to scale to larger volumes and higher throughput.

## TVM

TVM is a compiler stack for deep learning systems. It is designed to close the gap between the productivity-focused deep learning frameworks, and the performance- and efficiency-focused hardware backends. TVM works with deep learning frameworks to provide end to end compilation to different backends.

TVM provides the following main features:

- Compilation of deep learning models in Keras, MXNet, PyTorch, Tensorflow, CoreML, DarkNet into minimum deployable modules on diverse hardware backends.
- Infrastructure to automatic generate and optimize tensor operators on more backend with better performance.
