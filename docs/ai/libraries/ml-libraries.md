## Deep Graph Library (DGL)

Python package built to ease deep learning on graph, on top of existing DL frameworks.

Deep Graph Library (DGL) is a Python package built for easy implementation of graph neural network model family, on top of existing DL frameworks (currently supporting PyTorch, MXNet and TensorFlow). It offers a versatile control of message passing, speed optimization via auto-batching and highly tuned sparse matrix kernels, and multi-GPU/CPU training to scale to graphs of hundreds of millions of nodes and edges

## fastText (by facebookResearch)

FastText is an open-source, free, lightweight library that allows users to learn text representations and text classifiers. It works on standard, generic hardware. Models can later be reduced in size to even fit on mobile devices.

## CMU Sphinx

CMU Sphinx, also called Sphinx in short, is the general term to describe a group of [speech recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition) systems developed at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University). These include a series of speech recognizers (Sphinx 2 - 4) and an [acoustic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_Model) trainer (SphinxTrain)

## Graph-tool

Graph-tool is an efficient [Python](http://www.python.org/) module for manipulation and statistical analysis of [graphs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28mathematics%29)(a.k.a.[networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_theory)).

## GeoPy

Convert given string address to a location i.e. latitude and longitude values

## Biotite

The Biotite package bundles popular tools in computational biology into an unifying framework. It offers file I/O operations, analyses and manipulations for biological sequence and structure data. Furthermore, the package provides interfaces for popular biological databases and external software.

The internal structure and sequence representations are based onNumPyndarrays, taking the advantage of C-accelerated operations. Time consuming operations that could not be vectorised are mostly implemented inCythonin order to achieve C-accelerations in those places, too.

Additionally the package aims for simple usability and extensibility: The objects representing structures and sequences can be indexed and scliced like anndarray. Even the actual internalndarraysare easily accessible allowing advanced users to implement their own algorithms upon the existing types.

## Vaex

Vaex is a high performance Python library for lazy **Out-of-Core DataFrames** (similar to Pandas), to visualize and explore big tabular datasets. It calculates _statistics_ such as mean, sum, count, standard deviation etc, on an _N-dimensional grid_ for more than **a billion** (`10^9`) samples/rows **per second**. Visualization is done using **histograms**, **density plots** and **3d volume rendering**, allowing interactive exploration of big data. Vaex uses memory mapping, zero memory copy policy and lazy computations for best performance (no memory wasted).
