## MNIST database

The **MNIST database** (Modified [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology) database) is a large [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) of handwritten digits that is commonly used for [training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_set) various [image processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_processing) systems.

## ARC Corpus - AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC)

The ARC Corpus contains 14M unordered, science-related sentences including knowledge relevant to ARC, and is provided to as a starting point for addressing the challenge. The Corpus contains sentences from: science-related documents downloaded from the Web; dictionary definitions from Wiktionary, and articles from Simple Wikipedia that were tagged as science.

## YCSB Workloads

YCSB includes a set of core workloads that define a basic benchmark for cloud systems.

The **Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark** (YCSB) is an open-source specification and program suite for evaluating retrieval and maintenance capabilities of computer programs. It is often used to compare relative performance of [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) database management systems.

## TPC (Transaction Processing Performance Council)

TPC stands for Transaction Processing Performance Council. It is a non-profit organization that was founded in 1988. The TPC's goal is to define benchmarks for transaction processing and databases. They also distribute objective and verifiable performance data to the industry.

Here are some TPC benchmarks:

- TPC-C: Compares the performance of online transaction processing
- TPC-E: Measures the performance of online transaction processing systems
- TPC-H: A benchmark for transaction processing and databases specific to decision support

Other TPC benchmarks include: TPC-DS, TPCI.

TPC-DS has more difficult SQL like SQL queries with different types of JOINS compared to TPC-H.

DS - Decision Support

H and DS use similar datasets, and DS is basically the next-gen version of H. While H generates relatively straightforward queries (22 queries) and is generally shard-friendly, DS (99 queries) gets its kicks from using advanced SQL features and functions, and it loves lopsided filters. Running DS is notoriously, intentionally difficult
