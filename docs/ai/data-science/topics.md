## DBSCAN

Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is a data clustering algorithm proposed by Martin Ester, [Hans-Peter Kriegel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Peter_Kriegel), JÃ¶rg Sander and Xiaowei Xu in 1996.It is a [density-based clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis#Density-based_clustering) algorithm: given a set of points in some space, it groups together points that are closely packed together (points with many [nearby neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-radius_near_neighbors)), marking as outliers points that lie alone in low-density regions (whose nearest neighbors are too far away). DBSCAN is one of the most common clustering algorithms and also most cited in scientific literature

## Constraint Satisfaction

In [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) and [operations research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research), constraint satisfactionis the process of finding a solution to a set of [constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_(mathematics)) that impose conditions that the [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)) must [satisfy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability). A solution is therefore a set of values for the variables that satisfies all constraints - that is, a point in the [feasible region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasible_region).

The techniques used in constraint satisfaction depend on the kind of constraints being considered. Often used are [constraints on a finite domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_domain_constraint), to the point that [constraint satisfaction problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem) are typically identified with problems based on constraints on a finite domain. Such problems are usually solved via [search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm), in particular a form of [backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) or [local search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_search_(constraint_satisfaction)).[Constraint propagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_propagation) are other methods used on such problems; most of them are incomplete in general, that is, they may solve the problem or prove it unsatisfiable, but not always. Constraint propagation methods are also used in conjunction with search to make a given problem simpler to solve. Other considered kinds of constraints are on real or rational numbers; solving problems on these constraints is done via [variable elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_elimination) or the [simplex algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm).

Constraint satisfaction originated in the field of [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) in the 1970s. During the 1980s and 1990s, embedding of constraints into a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) were developed. Languages often used for [constraint programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming) are [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) and [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B).
