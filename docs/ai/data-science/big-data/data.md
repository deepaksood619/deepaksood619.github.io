- Interval - Examples: calendar dates, temperatures in Celsius or Fahrenheit
- Ratio - Examples: temperature in Kelvin, length, time, counts

## Properties of Attribute Values

The type of an attribute depends on which of the following properties it possesses:

- Distinctness: equal to, not equal to
- Order: < >

## Discrete and Continuous Attributes

### Discrete Attribute

- Has only a finite and countably infinite set of values
- Examples: zip code, counts, or the set of words in a collection of documents
- Often represented as integer variables
- Note: binary attributes are a special case of discrete attributes

### Continuous Attribute

- Has real numbers as attributes values
- Examples: temperature, height, or weight
- Practically, real values can only be measured and represented using a finite number of digits
- Continuous attributes are typically represented as floating-point variables
