# Statistics

1. **Statistics in Data Preparation**

Statistical methods are required in the preparation of train and test data for your machine learning model.

This includes techniques for

- Outlier detection
- Missing value imputation
- Data sampling
- Data scaling
- Variable encoding

A basic understanding of data distributions, descriptive statistics, and data visualization is required to help you identify the methods to choose when performing these tasks.

2. **Statistics in Model Evaluation**

Statistical methods are required when evaluating the skill of a machine learning model on data not seen during training.

This includes techniques for:

- Data sampling.
- Data resampling.
- Experimental design.

Resampling techniques such as k-fold cross-validation are often well understood by machine learning practitioners, but the rationale for why this method is required is not.

## k-fold cross validation

Cross-validation is a statistical method used to estimate the skill of machine learning models.

It is commonly used in applied machine learning to compare and select a model for a given predictive modeling problem because it is easy to understand, easy to implement, and results in skill estimates that generally have a lower bias than other methods.

3. **Statistics in Model Selection**

Statistical methods are required when selecting a final model or model configuration to use for a predictive modeling problem.

These include techniques for:

- Checking for a significant difference between results.
- Quantifying the size of the difference between results.

This might include the use of statistical hypothesis tests.

4. **Statistics in Model Presentation**

Statistical methods are required when presenting the skill of a final model to stakeholders.

This includes techniques for:

- Summarizing the expected skill of the model on average.
- Quantifying the expected variability of the skill of the model in practice.

This might include estimation statistics such as confidence intervals.

5. **Statistics in Prediction**

Statistical methods are required when making a prediction with a finalized model on new data.

This includes techniques for:

- Quantifying the expected variability for the prediction.

This might include estimation statistics such as prediction intervals.
