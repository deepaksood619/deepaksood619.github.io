# Recommender System

A Recommender System (a.k.a. Collaborative Filtering, Social Filtering, and Social Information Filtering) is an information filtering technique that takes details and data associated with a user's profile and compares it with similar data (habits, likes, opinions, etc.) of other users on the same service in order to present recommendations of what might be of interest to the original user.

Examples of web services that make use of Recommender Systems are: online auction/ecommerce websites, music services, movie and television show streaming services, etc.
