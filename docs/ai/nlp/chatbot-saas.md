Operator is the automation technology that powers all of Intercom's bots. Depending on which bot you're using, Operator will step in to help automate a simple task, answer a question, route customers to the correct inbox, and more.

Custom Bots are used to both proactively and reactively qualify leads, route customers to the correct team, and engage users and visitors on your website.

Task bots are triggered by actions that customers take on your website or app.
