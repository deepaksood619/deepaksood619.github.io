# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

A GAN is a type of neural network that is able to generate new data from scratch.

We can feed it a little bit of random noise as input, and it can produce realistic images of bedrooms, or birds, or whatever it is trained to generate.

GAN have two networks, one is actively trying to fool the other one, while this other one tries to distinguish these fake inputs (given by the first network) with other ones.
