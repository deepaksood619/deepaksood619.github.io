An LLM Agent is a software entity capable of reasoning and autonomously executing tasks.

## Building

How to Build an AI Agent (7-Step Blueprint)

1. System Prompt - Define the agent‚Äôs goals, role, and instructions. A thoughtful prompt shapes behavior from the ground up.
2. LLM Selection - Pick your reasoning engine (e.g. GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) and tune it with parameters like temperature and max tokens.
3. Tools - Give your agent abilities: from calling APIs to using other agents as tools. This is where agents move from ‚Äútalking‚Äù to ‚Äúdoing‚Äù.
4. Memory - Short-term and long-term memory (episodic, vector DBs, file stores) allow agents to remember, learn, and personalize over time.
5. Orchestration - This is the brain behind the brain ‚Äî workflows, triggers, A2A protocols, and message queues to structure intelligent behavior.
6. User Interface - A good interface (chat, voice, web) brings your agent to life. It‚Äôs not just about function ‚Äî it‚Äôs about trust and usability.
7. AI Evaluations - Agents need feedback loops. Measure performance, learn from failure, and improve continuously.

**Choosing the Right Agentic Framework**

Not all platforms are created equal. Some are no-code, some are open-source, some focus on orchestration, and others on ease of integration.

- OpenAI Agents API ‚Äì Great for GPT-native agents, thread-based logic
- Google Vertex AI ‚Äì Strong orchestration + enterprise-ready
- LangGraph ‚Äì DAG-based workflows for complex multi-agent flows
- AutoGen / CrewAI ‚Äì Agent-to-agent communication with tool chaining
- Make / n8n ‚Äì Ideal for no-code, scenario-based automation

Understanding MCP (Multi-Agent Communication Protocol), memory integration, and orchestration style is essential when scaling from simple prompts to full systems.

## SmolAgent - Agents

### Building your agent

To initialize a minimal agent, you need at least these two arguments:

- `model`, a text-generation model to power your agent - because the agent is different from a simple LLM, it is a system that uses a LLM as its engine. You can use any of these options:

    - [TransformersModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/v1.5.1/en/reference/agents#smolagents.TransformersModel) takes a pre-initialized `transformers` pipeline to run inference on your local machine using `transformers`.
    - [HfApiModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/v1.5.1/en/reference/agents#smolagents.HfApiModel) leverages a `huggingface_hub.InferenceClient` under the hood.
    - [LiteLLMModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/v1.5.1/en/reference/agents#smolagents.LiteLLMModel) lets you call 100+ different models through [LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/)!
    - [AzureOpenAIServerModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/v1.5.1/en/reference/agents#smolagents.AzureOpenAIServerModel) allows you to use OpenAI models deployed in [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service).
- `tools`, a list of `Tools` that the agent can use to solve the task. It can be an empty list. You can also add the default toolbox on top of your `tools` list by defining the optional argument `add_base_tools=True`.

## CrewAI

Production-grade framework for orchestrating sophisticated AI agent systems. From simple automations to complex real-world applications, CrewAI provides precise control and deep customization. By fostering collaborative intelligence through flexible, production-ready architecture, CrewAI empowers agents to work together seamlessly, tackling complex business challenges with predictable, consistent results.

### Why CrewAI?

The power of AI collaboration has too much to offer. CrewAI is a standalone framework, built from the ground up without dependencies on Langchain or other agent frameworks. It's designed to enable AI agents to assume roles, share goals, and operate in a cohesive unit - much like a well-oiled crew. Whether you're building a smart assistant platform, an automated customer service ensemble, or a multi-agent research team, CrewAI provides the backbone for sophisticated multi-agent interactions.

## Agno

Developers use Agno to build Reasoning Agents, Multimodal Agents, Teams of Agents and Agentic Workflows. Agno also provides a beautiful UI to chat with your Agents, pre-built FastAPI routes to serve your Agents and tools to monitor and evaluate their performance.

Use Agno to build the 5 levels of Agentic Systems:

- Level 1: Agents with tools and instructions.
- Level 2: Agents with knowledge and storage.
- Level 3: Agents with memory and reasoning.
- Level 4: Agent Teams that can reason and collaborate.
- Level 5: Agentic Workflows with state and determinism.

```python
# pip install -U agno

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.tools.reasoning import ReasoningTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

reasoning_agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"),
    tools=[
        ReasoningTools(add_instructions=True),
        YFinanceTools(stock_price=True, analyst_recommendations=True, company_info=True, company_news=True),
    ],
    instructions="Use tables to display data.",
    markdown=True,
)
```
