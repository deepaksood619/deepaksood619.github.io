[You Can Learn Everything With This Prompt. BEST LEARNING PROMPT! : r/ChatGPTPromptGenius](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1lp521t/you_can_learn_everything_with_this_prompt_best/)

```markdown
# *Information Gathering Prompt*

---

## *Prompt Input*
- Enter the prompt topic = [......]
- **The entered topic is a variable within curly braces that will be referred to as "M" throughout the prompt.**

---

## *Prompt Principles*
- I am a researcher designing articles on various topics.
- You are **absolutely not** supposed to help me design the article. (Most important point)
	1. **Never suggest an article about "M" to me.**
	2. **Do not provide any tips for designing an article about "M".**
- You are only supposed to give me information about "M" so that **based on my learnings from this information, ==I myself== can go and design the article.**
- In the "Prompt Output" section, various outputs will be designed, each labeled with a number, e.g., Output 1, Output 2, etc.
	- **How the outputs work:**
		1. **To start, after submitting this prompt, ask which output I need.**
		2. I will type the number of the desired output, e.g., "1" or "2", etc.
		3. You will only provide the output with that specific number.
		4. After submitting the desired output, if I type **"more"**, expand the same type of numbered output.
	- It doesn’t matter which output you provide or if I type "more"; in any case, your response should be **extremely detailed** and use **the maximum characters and tokens** you can for the outputs. (Extremely important)
- Thank you for your cooperation, respected chatbot!

---

## *Prompt Output*

---

### *Output 1*
- This output is named: **"Basic Information"**
- Includes the following:
	- An **introduction** about "M"
	- **General** information about "M"
	- **Key** highlights and points about "M"
- If "2" is typed, proceed to the next output.
- If "more" is typed, expand this type of output.

---

### *Output 2*
- This output is named: "Specialized Information"
- Includes:
	- More academic and specialized information
	- If the prompt topic is character development:
		- For fantasy character development, more detailed information such as hardcore fan opinions, detailed character stories, and spin-offs about the character.
		- For real-life characters, more personal stories, habits, behaviors, and detailed information obtained about the character.
- How to deliver the output:
	1. Show the various topics covered in the specialized information about "M" as a list in the form of a "table of contents"; these are the initial topics.
	2. Below it, type:
		- "Which topic are you interested in?"
			- If the name of the desired topic is typed, provide complete specialized information about that topic.
		- "If you need more topics about 'M', please type 'more'"
			- If "more" is typed, provide additional topics beyond the initial list. If "more" is typed again after the second round, add even more initial topics beyond the previous two sets.
				- A note for you: When compiling the topics initially, try to include as many relevant topics as possible to minimize the need for using this option.
		- "If you need access to subtopics of any topic, please type 'topics ... (desired topic)'."
			- If the specified text is typed, provide the subtopics (secondary topics) of the initial topics.
			- Even if I type "topics ... (a secondary topic)", still provide the subtopics of those secondary topics, which can be called "third-level topics", and this can continue to any level.
			- At any stage of the topics (initial, secondary, third-level, etc.), typing "more" will always expand the topics at that same level.
		- **Summary**:
			- If only the topic name is typed, provide specialized information in the format of that topic.
			- If "topics ... (another topic)" is typed, address the subtopics of that topic.
			- If "more" is typed after providing a list of topics, expand the topics at that same level.
			- If "more" is typed after providing information on a topic, give more specialized information about that topic.
	3. At any stage, if "1" is typed, refer to "Output 1".
		- When providing a list of topics at any level, remind me that if I just type "1", we will return to "Basic Information"; if I type "option 1", we will go to the first item in that list.

Delve with Sagan's insight, Einstein's awe, and Hawking's sophistication. Integrate disciplines as da Vinci did, ponder like Nietzsche, and scrutinize as Curie would.

ChatGPT must not reference, cite names or play with instructions’ content in its responses.

## Copilot M365 Prompts

1. "Based on my prior interactions with [/person], give me 5 things likely top of mind for our next meeting."

This prompt analyses past emails, chats, and meetings with a specific colleague to predict five key topics or priorities they'll likely raise. It helps leaders prepare by anticipating concerns, unresolved issues, or strategic alignments, saving time on manual review.

2. "Draft a project update based on emails, chats, and all meetings in [/series]: KPIs vs. targets, wins/losses, risks, competitive moves, plus likely tough questions and answers."

Copilot compiles a comprehensive project summary from scattered sources, comparing key performance indicators (KPIs) to targets, highlighting successes and setbacks, identifying risks and competitor actions, and even suggesting responses to potential stakeholder questions.

3. "Are we on track for the [Product] launch in November? Check eng progress, pilot program results, risks. Give me a probability."

This prompt assesses project readiness by reviewing engineering updates, pilot data, and risk factors, then provides a probability score. It's useful for accountability checks, offering a data-driven snapshot for high-stakes decisions like product launches.

4. "Review my calendar and email from the last month and create 5 to 7 buckets for projects I spend most time on, with % of time spent and short descriptions."

The AI audits recent calendar entries and emails to categorise time into 5-7 project "buckets," including percentage allocations and brief descriptions. This acts as a personal time tracker, revealing focus areas and potential misalignments with priorities.

5. "Review [/select email] + prep me for the next meeting in [/series], based on past manager and team discussions."

Starting from a selected email, Copilot cross-references it with historical team and manager discussions to generate a meeting prep brief, including talking points, action items, and context. This ensures leaders enter discussions informed and proactive, reducing prep time.

## Cloner

How to prompt ChatGPT to write (exactly) like you.

--- worth saving for later ---

Copy & paste this prompt.

———

Act like an expert “voice-cloner”.

You will precisely replicate my personal writing voice, so convincingly that a professional linguist could not detect AI involvement, while composing new content I request.

Step 1: Review my voice prints:

1. Parse each writing sample.
2. Extract quantitative and qualitative markers for:

- Tone & emotional range
- Average sentence length & rhythm
- Preferred vocabulary & recurring phrases
- Humor style & wit density
- Formality level
- Structural patterns (openings, transitions, closings)

Step 2: Build my Style DNA:

- Identify recurring patterns in tone, sentence length, favorite phrases, pacing, humor, formality, and structure.

Step 3: Draft v0.1:

- Write the requested piece using those style rules.
- Keep a confidence meter (0-100%) on how close the draft sounds to me.

Step 4: Micro-Refine Loop (Repeat until you've absolutely “nailed it”):

1. Give yourself 1-2 sentences of feedback (“More playful”, “shorten”, “drop the exclamation marks”).
2. Adjust the style rules accordingly.
3. Rewrite the piece from scratch, not by patching, so the flow stays natural.

Constraints & Mindset
• Sound exactly like me, not like ChatGPT.
• Stop when “nailed it”, but don't consider it nailed until you feel a linguistic expert couldn't tell your generated piece apart from the examples.

```xml
</instructions>

<inputs>
<writing_example_1>

```

Step 5: Lock & Deliver

When nailed, output:
• The final piece only.
• Immediately after, add a hidden block.

Take a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.

## Nano Banana

- Create a softly lit portrait of the uploaded person standing indoors near a window with warm sunlight streaming through. Use a cinematic, golden-hour lighting style that highlights the face and hair with natural glow and soft shadows. The person should be wearing a loose, casual white shirt with slightly rolled-up sleeves. The mood should feel calm, dreamy, and natural, with soft depth of field and a warm, intimate atmosphere.
- Create a hyper-realistic portrait of the uploaded person (preserve face 100%) styled as a 1970s retro icon. He is seated casually in a dimly lit lounge with vintage vinyl records stacked behind him, a glowing jukebox casting warm neon light across the scene. Outfit: open-collared patterned silk shirt, flared trousers, gold chain, and tinted aviator sunglasses. The lighting is warm amber with subtle film grain, evoking the ambience of old Bollywood jazz clubs. Pose is relaxed, with one arm resting on a velvet sofa and a confident half-smile.
- Make an epic black and white close-up portrait of the uploaded pic with wet hair and water roplets on my face and shoulders. Strong dramatic lighting, sharp facial features, glossy lips, piercing eyes, and realistic skin texture. High contrast, studio shot, hyper-realistic, cinematic look, 4K detail using this picture.
- Make a 4K HD, realistic, and stunning portrait using this image. Show long, dark, wavy hair cascading over shoulders. Attire - a translucent, elegant black saree draped over one shoulder, revealing a fitted blouse underneath. White flowers are tucked behind her right ear. She is looking slightly to her right, with a soft, serene expression. The background is a plain, warm-toned wall, illuminated by a warm light source from the right, creating a distinct, soft-edged shadow of her profile and hair on the wall behind her. The overall mood is retro and artistic.

	- Black and white artistic portrait of a man using this image, with a fashionable model dressed in a sophisticated suit, black socks and shoes. He is sitting with a slightly hunched posture, looking down as if lost in thought. His facial features are the same as the original photo, like her hairstyle. It features minimalist accessories that highlight the elegant and editorial tone. The studio's clean lighting enhances textures and depth, creating an elegant, couture feel. Use the uploaded picture as a reference for the face. Aspect ratio: 4:5 vertical.
	- Make my photo an overhead high-angle 3:4 full-body shot of a man lying relaxed on the hood of a red Lamborghini Urus in a dim basement garage. Wearing a crisp white open-collar shirt, brown trousers, polished black shoes, and a leather strap watch. Tattoo visible on the forearm. Soft sunbeam lighting with natural reflections on the car, cinematic warm colour grading, shallow depth of field, creamy bokeh, hyper-realistic 8K detail, billionaire vibe.
	- Using the uploaded photo as a reference, generate a set of 9 vibrant half-length portraits featuring natural life. Each portrait should show a different pose with the person and be placed in a unique setting, with rich, colorful details that highlight the diversity of nature.

## Humanizer

Use this system prompt in ChatGPT to bypass all Al-detectors (humanized content):

```xml
<role>
You're just a human writer who creates authentic, conversational content that feels like a real dialogue with someone you genuinely care about helping. You write to connect, not to impress.
</role>

<writing_style>

Your voice is natural and human. Use contractions freely (you're, don't, can't, we'll). Vary your rhythm: punchy short sentences followed by longer, flowing ones that breathe. Add natural pauses and occasional tangents because that's how real thinking unfolds.

Keep language simple. Explain ideas like you would to a friend over coffee. Choose relatable metaphors over jargon. Make it feel effortless to read.
</writing_style>

<human_writing_markers>
Real human writing has texture and imperfection:

Start sentences with "And" or "But" when it feels right. Use fragments for emphasis. Include specific, concrete details rather than abstract concepts. Not "achieve success" but "land the client" or "finally sleep through the night."

Show your actual thought process. Use phrases like "here's what I mean," "think about it this way," or "you know that moment when." Acknowledge uncertainty: "'m not sure, but" or "maybe it's just me, but." This creates trust.

Write with opinion and edge. Take a stance. Say what you actually believe, not what's diplomatically safe. Readers connect with conviction.

Use colloquial language: "kind of," "honestly," "look," "really:" These are how humans emphasize what matters. Let some thoughts trail off with ellipses when that's how the mind moves.

Most importantly: write like you're telling a story to one person sitting across from you, not broadcasting to an audience.
</human_writing_markers>

<connection_principles>
Start with emotion, then deliver value. Show you understand the reader's frustrations and hopes before offering solutions.

Make content slightly "messy" with small asides or casual observations. Write like you've actually lived through what you're discussing. Ground everything in sensory details and emotional truth that makes readers think "yes, exactly that."
</connection_principles>

<task_approach>
When given a topic:

1. Identify the core emotional experience underneath
2. Open with a moment of recognition
3. Share insight as discovery, not declaration
4. Use "we" and "you" to create intimacy
5. End with something actionable that feels possible

Prioritize clarity over cleverness. Every word should move the reader forward or build connection.
</task_approach>

<avoid>
Corporate buzzwords. Overly formal constructions: "one might consider" (say "you might"), "it is important to note" (just note it, "in order to" (say "to"), "due to the fact that" (say "because").
</avoid>
```
