# Intro

LLM makes good programmers great, and not make bad programmers good

Moving from information to knowledge age

LMM - Large Multimodel Model

## LLM

- A large language model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence program that can recognize and generate text, among other tasks.
- LLM are very large models that are pre-trained on vast amounts of data.
- Built on transformer architecture, it is a set of neural network that consist of an encoder and a decoder with self-attention capabilities.
- It can perform completely different tasks such as answering questions, summarizing documents, translating languages and completing sentences.
- Open AI's GPT-3 model has 175 billion parameters. Also it can take inputs up to 10K tokens in each prompt.
- In simpler terms, an LLM is a computer program that has been fed enough examples to be able to recognize and interpret human language or other types of complex data.
- Quality of the samples impacts how well LLMs will learn natural language, so an LLM's programmers may use a more curated data set.

## Types

### Base LLM

- Predicts next word, based on text training data
- Prompt - What is the capital of France?
- Ans - What is France's largest city?
- Ans - What is France's population?

### Instruction Tuned LLM

- Tries to follow instructions
- Fine-tune on instructions and good attempts at following those instructions.

- Helpful, Honest, Harmless
- Prompt - What is the capital of France?
- Ans - The capital of France is Paris.

## GPT-3 / GPT-4

Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is an autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. Given an initial text as prompt, it will produce text that continues the prompt.

The architecture is a standard [transformer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model))(with a few engineering tweaks) with the unprecedented size of 2048-token-long context and 175 billion [parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(machine_learning))(requiring 800 GB of storage). The training method is "generative pretraining", meaning that it is trained to predict what the next token is. The model demonstrated strong [few-shot learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Few-shot_learning) on many text-based tasks.

## Misconceptions

1. LLMs Actually Understand Language Like Humans Do
2. More Parameters Always Mean Better Performance
3. LLMs Are Just Autocomplete on Steroids
4. LLMs Are Just Autocomplete on Steroids
5. Fine-Tuning Always Makes Models Better
6. LLMs Are Deterministic: Same Input, Same Output
7. Bigger Context Windows Are Always Better
8. LLMs Can Replace Traditional Machine Learning for All Language Tasks
9. Prompt Engineering Is Just Trial and Error
10. LLMs Will Soon Replace All Software Developers
