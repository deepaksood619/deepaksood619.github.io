# Top 50 Large Language Model (LLM) Interview

## Question 1: What does tokenization entail, and why is it critical for LLMs?

Tokenization involves breaking down text into smaller units, or tokens, such as words, subwords, or characters. For example, "artificial" might be split into "art," "ific," and "ial." This process is vital because LLMs process numerical representations of tokens, not raw text. Tokenization enables models to handle diverse languages, manage rare or unknown words, and optimize vocabulary size, enhancing computational efficiency and model performance.

## Question 2: How does the attention mechanism function in transformer models?

The attention mechanism allows LLMs to weigh the importance of different tokens in a sequence when generating or interpreting text. It computes similarity scores between query, key, and value vectors, using operations like dot products, to focus on relevant tokens. For instance, in "The cat chased the mouse," attention helps the model link "mouse" to "chased." This mechanism improves context understanding, making transformers highly effective for NLP tasks.

## Question 3: What is the context window in LLMs, and why does it matter?

The context window refers to the number of tokens an LLM can process at once, defining its "memory" for understanding or generating text. A larger window, like 32,000 tokens, allows the model to consider more context, improving coherence in tasks like summariza- tion. However, it increases computational costs. Balancing window size with efficiency is crucial for practical LLM deployment.

## Question 4: What distinguishes LoRA from QLoRA in fine tuning LLMs?

LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a fine-tuning method that adds low-rank matrices to a models layers, enabling efficient adaptation with minimal memory overhead. QLoRA extends this by applying quantization (e.g., 4-bit precision) to further reduce memory usage while maintaining accuracy. For example, QLoRA can fine-tune a 70B-parameter model on a single GPU, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments.

## Question 5: How does beam search improve text generation compared to greedy decoding?

Beam search explores multiple word sequences during text generation, keeping the top kcandidates (beams) at each step, unlike greedy decoding, which selects only the most probable word. This approach, withk= 5, for instance, ensures more coherent outputs by balancing probability and diversity, especially in tasks like machine translation or dialogue generation.

## Question 6: What role does temperature play in controlling LLM output?

Temperature is a hyperparameter that adjusts the randomness of token selection in text generation. A low temperature (e.g., 0.3) favors high-probability tokens, producing predictable outputs. A high temperature (e.g., 1.5) increases diversity by flattening the probability distribution. Setting temperature to 0.8 often balances creativity and coherence for tasks like storytelling.

## Question 7: What is masked language modeling, and how does it aid pretraining?

Masked language modeling (MLM) involves hiding random tokens in a sequence and training the model to predict them based on context. Used in models like BERT, MLM fosters bidirectional understanding of language, enabling the model to grasp semantic relationships. This pretraining approach equips LLMs for tasks like sentiment analysis or question answering.

## Question 8: What are sequence-to-sequence models, and where are they applied?

Sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models transform an input sequence into an output sequence, often of different lengths. They consist of an encoder to process the input and a decoder to generate the output. Applications include machine translation (e.g., English to Spanish), text summarization, and chatbots, where variable-length inputs and outputs are common.

## Question 9: How do autoregressive and masked models differ in LLM training?

Autoregressive models, like GPT, predict tokens sequentially based on prior tokens, excelling in generative tasks such as text completion. Masked models, like BERT, predicmasked tokens using bidirectional context, making them ideal for understanding tasklike classification. Their training objectives shape their strengths in generation versucomprehension.

## Question 10: What are embeddings, and how are they initialized in LLMs?

Embeddings are dense vectors that represent tokens in a continuous space, capturing semantic and syntactic properties. They are often initialized randomly or with pretrained models like GloVe, then fine-tuned during training. For example, the embedding for "dog" might evolve to reflect its context in pet-related tasks, enhancing model accuracy.

## Question 11: What is next sentence prediction, and how does it enhance LLMs?

Next sentence prediction (NSP) trains models to determine if two sentences are consecutive or unrelated. During pretraining, models like BERT learn to classify 50% positive (sequential) and 50% negative (random) sentence pairs. NSP improves coherencin tasks like dialogue systems or document summarization by understanding sentencrelationships.

## Question 12: How do top-k and top-p sampling differ in text generation?

Top-k sampling selects thekmost probable tokens (e.g.,k= 20) for random sampling, ensuring controlled diversity. Top-p (nucleus) sampling chooses tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds a thresholdp(e.g., 0.95), adapting to context. Top-p offers more flexibility, producing varied yet coherent outputs in creative writing.

## Question 13: Why is prompt engineering crucial for LLM performance?

Prompt engineering involves designing inputs to elicit desired LLM responses. A clear prompt, like "Summarize this article in 100 words," improves output relevance compared to vague instructions. Its especially effective in zero-shot or few-shot settings, enabling LLMs to tackle tasks like translation or classification without extensive fine-tuning.

## Question 14: How can LLMs avoid catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning?

Catastrophic forgetting occurs when fine-tuning erases prior knowledge. Mitigation strategies include:

- Rehearsal: Mixing old and new data during training.
- Elastic Weight Consolidation: Prioritizing critical weights to preserve knowledge.
- Modular Architectures: Adding task-specific modules to avoid overwriting.

These methods ensure LLMs retain versatility across tasks.

## Question 15: What is model distillation, and how does it benefit LLMs?

Model distillation trains a smaller "student" model to mimic a larger "teacher" models outputs, using soft probabilities rather than hard labels. This reduces memory and com- putational requirements, enabling deployment on devices like smartphones while retaining near-teacher performance, ideal for real-time applications.

## Question 16: How do LLMs manage out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words?

LLMs use subword tokenization, like Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), to break OOV words into known subword units. For instance, "cryptocurrency" might split into "crypto" and "currency." This approach allows LLMs to process rare or new words, ensuring robust language understanding and generation.

## Question 17: How do transformers improve on traditional Seq2Seq models?

Transformers overcome Seq2Seq limitations by:

- Parallel Processing: Self-attention enables simultaneous token processing, unlike sequential RNNs.
- Long-Range Dependencies: Attention captures distant token relationships.
- Positional Encodings: These preserve sequence order.

These features enhance scalability and performance in tasks like translation.

## Question 18: What is overfitting, and how can it be mitigated in LLMs?

Overfitting occurs when a model memorizes training data, failing to generalize. Mitigation includes:

- Regularization: L1/L2 penalties simplify models.
- Dropout: Randomly disables neurons during training.
- Early Stopping: Halts training when validation performance plateaus.

These techniques ensure robust generalization to unseen data.

## Question 19: What are generative versus discriminative models in NLP?

Generative models, like GPT, model joint probabilities to create new data, such as text or images.

## Question 21: What are positional encodings, and why are they used?

Positional encodings add sequence order information to transformer inputs, as self-attention lacks inherent order awareness. Using sinusoidal functions or learned vectors, they ensure tokens like "king" and "crown" are interpreted correctly based on position, critical for tasks like translation.

## Question 22: What is multi-head attention, and how does it enhance LLMs?

Multi-head attention splits queries, keys, and values into multiple subspaces, allowing the model to focus on different aspects of the input simultaneously. For example, in a sentence, one head might focus on syntax, another on semantics. This improves the models ability to capture complex patterns.

## Question 23: How is the softmax function applied in attention mechanisms?

The softmax function normalizes attention scores into a probability distribution:

```
softmax(xi) =
exi
âˆ‘
je
xj
```

In attention, it converts raw similarity scores (from query-key dot products) into weights, emphasizing relevant tokens. This ensures the model focuses on contextually important parts of the input.

## Question 24: How does the dot product contribute to self-attention?

In self-attention, the dot product between query (Q) and key (K) vectors computes similarity scores:

fâ€²(x) =
{

1 ifx> 0
0 otherwise
```

Its sparsity and non-linearity prevent vanishing gradients, making ReLU computationally efficient and widely used in LLMs for robust training.

## Question 31: How does the chain rule apply to gradient descent in LLMs?

The chain rule computes derivatives of composite functions:

```
d
dx
f(g(x)) =fâ€²(g(x))Â·gâ€²(x)
```

In gradient descent, it enables backpropagation to calculate gradients layer by layer, updating parameters to minimize loss efficiently across deep LLM architectures.

## Question 32: How are attention scores calculated in transformers?
