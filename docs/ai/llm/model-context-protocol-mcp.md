# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

A protocol for seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. Whether you're building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating custom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context they need.

MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

**Transport pipes**

- **stdio:** server and client at one end, basically the same local machine
- **SSE:** server to client streaming with HTTP POST requests for client to server communication basically when client and host server are different (for prod env)

## Why MCP?

MCP helps you build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs. LLMs frequently need to integrate with data and tools, and MCP provides:

- A growing list of pre-built integrations that your LLM can directly plug into
- The flexibility to switch between LLM providers and vendors
- Best practices for securing your data within your infrastructure

## General Architecture

At its core, MCP follows a client-server architecture where a host application can connect to multiple servers:

![MCP Architecture](../../media/Screenshot%202025-05-30%20at%2011.53.06%20PM.jpg)

- **MCP Hosts**: Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want to access data through MCP
- **MCP Clients**: Protocol clients that maintain 1:1 connections with servers
- **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol
- **Local Data Sources**: Your computer’s files, databases, and services that MCP servers can securely access
- **Remote Services**: External systems available over the internet (e.g., through APIs) that MCP servers can connect to

## How MCP Works

      participant User as User
      participant Host as VScode / Claude / ChatGPT Desktop
      participant Client as MCP Client
      participant Server as MCP Server
      participant Resource as External Service
      User ->> Host: Open application
      Host ->> Client: Initialize client
      Client ->> Server: initialize request with capabilities
      Server ->> Client: initialize response with capabilities
      Client ->> Server: initialized notification
      User ->> Host: Make a request
      Host ->> Client: Forward request
      alt Resource Request (Application-controlled)
         Note right of Client: A Resource is context data from the server<br/>Examples: file contents,<br/>code history,<br/>database schemas<br/>Resources help LLMs understand context
         Client ->> Server: resources/list or resources/read
         Server ->> Resource: Fetch data (e.g., read files, query DB)
         Resource ->> Server: Return data
         Server ->> Client: Resource content
         Client ->> Host: Add context to LLM prompt
      else Tool Execution (Model-controlled)
         Note right of Client: A Tool is a function the LLM can call<br/>Examples: web search,<br/>file writing,<br/>API calls<br/>Tools let LLMs take actions
         Client ->> Server: tools/call
         Server ->> Resource: Execute operation
         Resource ->> Server: Return result
         Server ->> Client: Tool result
         Client ->> Host: Show result to LLM
      else Sampling Request (Server-initiated)
         Note right of Server: Sampling lets servers request LLM generations<br/>Examples: analyzing data,<br/>making decisions<br/>Enables agentic/recursive workflows
         Server ->> Client: sampling/createMessage
         Client ->> Host: Request LLM generation
         Host ->> User: Request approval (optional)
         User ->> Host: Approve request
         Host ->> Client: Return generation
         Client ->> Server: Generation result
      end
      Client ->> Host: Return response
      Host ->> User: Display result
      User ->> Host: Close application
      Host ->> Client: Terminate
