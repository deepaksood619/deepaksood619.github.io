An LLM Agent is a software entity capable of reasoning and autonomously executing tasks.

## SmolAgent - Agents

### Building your agent

To initialize a minimal agent, you need at least these two arguments:

- `model`, a text-generation model to power your agent - because the agent is different from a simple LLM, it is a system that uses a LLM as its engine. You can use any of these options:

    - [TransformersModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/v1.5.1/en/reference/agents#smolagents.TransformersModel) takes a pre-initialized `transformers` pipeline to run inference on your local machine using `transformers`.
    - [HfApiModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/v1.5.1/en/reference/agents#smolagents.HfApiModel) leverages a `huggingface_hub.InferenceClient` under the hood.
    - [LiteLLMModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/v1.5.1/en/reference/agents#smolagents.LiteLLMModel) lets you call 100+ different models through [LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/)!
    - [AzureOpenAIServerModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/v1.5.1/en/reference/agents#smolagents.AzureOpenAIServerModel) allows you to use OpenAI models deployed in [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service).
- `tools`, a list of `Tools` that the agent can use to solve the task. It can be an empty list. You can also add the default toolbox on top of your `tools` list by defining the optional argument `add_base_tools=True`.

## CrewAI

Production-grade framework for orchestrating sophisticated AI agent systems. From simple automations to complex real-world applications, CrewAI provides precise control and deep customization. By fostering collaborative intelligence through flexible, production-ready architecture, CrewAI empowers agents to work together seamlessly, tackling complex business challenges with predictable, consistent results.

### Why CrewAI?

The power of AI collaboration has too much to offer. CrewAI is a standalone framework, built from the ground up without dependencies on Langchain or other agent frameworks. It's designed to enable AI agents to assume roles, share goals, and operate in a cohesive unit - much like a well-oiled crew. Whether you're building a smart assistant platform, an automated customer service ensemble, or a multi-agent research team, CrewAI provides the backbone for sophisticated multi-agent interactions.
