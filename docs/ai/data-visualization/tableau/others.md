## Tableau Migration Tool

- [About Tableau Content Migration Tool - Tableau](https://help.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/cmt-intro.htm)
- The Content Migration Tool provides an easy way to copy or migrate content between Tableau Server sites. You can do this between sites on a single Tableau Server installation, or if you have user-based licensing, between sites on separate installations (for example, between a development instance of Tableau Server and a production installation). The Content Migration Tool user interface walks you through the steps necessary to build a "migration plan" that you can use once or as a template for multiple migrations.
