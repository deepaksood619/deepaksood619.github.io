## PowerBI vs Google Data Studio

Overall, both Power BI and Google data studio are similar when it comes to data integration, **Power BI has better ease of working**(given our understanding of Microsoft tools such as Excel) and functionality whereas **Google data studio requires significant learning and workaround** to achievesimilar visualizations. Please find below details for the same.

- **Data Integration**
    - Both the tools connect to various data sources without much issues (In few instances, third party tools might be required for Google Data Studio).
    - However, Data studio has an edge when connecting with Google services. Google services like AdWords, Google Sheets and Google Analytics are natively fully integrated with Google Data Studio.
    - Google data studio might need third party applications such as Supermetricsfor adding few data sources.
- **Functionality**
    - Power BI has a large functionality with sophisticated functions. For example, basic functionality such asline, bar and pie chartsare available in both the tools, sophisticated functions suchCohort analysis, standard funnelare not available in Google data. However, I believe these visualizations could be achievedby modifying data using SQL queries.
    - Power BI is superior to Google data studio in processing data visualization with large data.
- **Ease of working**
    - Power BI's DAX functions being similarto Excel formulas (which most of the team members have experience on), is a bit easier to work on.
    - Working on Google data studio would be a learningcurve.
- **Pricing**
    - Power BI costs $10 per user while Google data studio is free of cost.
    - However, adding few data sources to Google data studio needs third party applications such as Supermetrics which costs between $20 - $50.
    - Given Google data studio is a cloud based application, it would eliminate the need for AWS machine(needed to build Power BI report)to builtthe reports.

## Redash

Redash was built to allow fast and easy access to billions of records, that we process and collect using Amazon Redshift ("petabyte scale data warehouse" that "speaks" PostgreSQL). Today Redash has support for querying multiple databases, including: Redshift, Google BigQuery, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Graphite, Presto, Google Spreadsheets, Cloudera Impala, Hive and custom scripts.

### Redash consists of two parts

1. **Query Editor:** think of [JS Fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) for SQL queries. It's your way to share data in the organization in an open way, by sharing both the dataset and the query that generated it. This way everyone can peer review not only the resulting dataset but also the process that generated it. Also it's possible to fork it and generate new datasets and reach new insights.
2. **Visualizations and Dashboards:** once you have a dataset, you can create different visualizations out of it, and then combine several visualizations into a single dashboard. Currently Redash supports charts, pivot table, cohorts and [more](https://redash.io/help/user-guide/visualizations/visualization-types)

## AWS QuickSight

Amazon QuickSight is built with "SPICE" -- a Super-fast, Parallel, In-memory Calculation Engine. Built from the ground up for the cloud, SPICE uses a combination of columnar storage, in-memory technologies enabled through the latest hardware innovations and machine code generation to run interactive queries on large datasets and get rapid responses. SPICE supports rich calculations to help you derive valuable insights from your analysis without worrying about provisioning or managing infrastructure. Data in SPICE is persisted until it is explicitly deleted by the user. SPICE also automatically replicates data for high availability and enables QuickSight to scale to hundreds of thousands of users who can all simultaneously perform fast interactive analysis across a wide variety of AWS data sources.

- Quicksight account started may with 3 users, then on May 8th, 2 new users were created, which means there were 5 users in total
- Users are charged monthly whether or not you delete the users in the same month, it will still charge for the user until the last day of the month. Meaning, when a user is deleted from the account, billing continues until the last day of the month. For example, a user added on the 1st is deleted on the same day, they are still billed the full $24 since its a monthly user charge
- 5 users x $24 per user = $120 - so the total $120/31days = $3.87 per day
