# Course - Feature Engineering

Introduction

Want to know how you can improve the accuracy of your ML models? What about how to find which data columns make the most useful features? Welcome to Feature Engineering where we will discuss good vs bad features and how you can preprocess and transform them for optimal use in your models.

Raw Data to Features

Feature engineering is often the longest and most difficult phase of building your ML project. In the feature engineering process, you start with your raw data and use your own domain knowledge to create features that will make your machine learning algorithms work. In this module we explore what makes a good feature and how to represent them in your ML model.

TF Transform

TensorFlow Transform (tf.Transform) is a library for preprocessing data with TensorFlow. tf.Transform is useful for preprocessing that requires a full pass the data, such as: - normalizing an input value by mean and stdev - integerizing a vocabulary by looking at all input examples for values - bucketizing inputs based on the observed data distribution In this module we will explore use cases for tf.Transform.
