## Problem 1

Modern healthcare systems store patient information across multiple digital platforms, capturing everything from vital signs and medications to diagnoses and immune responses. While these systems are meant to support patient care, they often function in isolation, making it difficult for healthcare providers to access a complete, continuous view of a patient’s medical history.

Doctors and nurses frequently encounter fragmented records, where critical details are scattered across different databases that don’t communicate with one another. This lack of seamless integration can lead to gaps in care, redundant tests, and delays in decision-making. Without a way to connect these separate data sources, valuable insights remain hidden, and patient care becomes more about educated guesses than data-driven decisions.

The challenge is to create a secure and connected system that allows different platforms to share and interpret data in real time while ensuring patient privacy. How can we overcome this challenge?

## Problem 2

With thousands of courses available, platforms like LinkedIn Learning have made skill development more accessible than ever. But with so many options, professionals often struggle to figure out what to learn next. The challenge isn’t just finding courses—it’s knowing which skills will truly help them grow in their careers.

Many people spend hours browsing through learning platforms, unsure if they’re choosing the right path. They might take courses that don’t align with their strengths or miss out on key skills that could open new opportunities. The real need isn’t just access to learning but guidance on what to learn and why.

LinkedIn Learning offers a vast library of courses, yet without a clear way to assess current abilities and future goals, learners can feel lost. What could be done to solve this problem?

## Problem 3

Millions of people send money across borders every day, often to support their families back home. But behind these transactions lies a complicated system where money moves through multiple banks and intermediaries, each taking a cut along the way. By the time the transfer is complete—often after several days—the recipient gets less than what was originally sent.

Traditional banking systems and money transfer services charge high fees, sometimes as much as 10% per transaction. On top of that, hidden exchange rate markups further reduce the final amount received. For many migrant workers and individuals sending remittances, these extra costs add up, making financial support less effective.

In a world where digital payments are faster than ever, why does sending money across borders still feel slow, expensive, and inefficient? What would be an effective solution for this problem?

## Problem 4

In fast-paced industries like tech and manufacturing, teams work on complex projects that require seamless coordination. But as organizations grow, different teams often focus on their own tasks without a clear view of how their work fits into the bigger picture. When communication is scattered and tracking progress becomes difficult, small inefficiencies can quickly add up.

Without a system that keeps everyone aligned, missed updates and unstructured workflows can lead to delays, higher costs, and unnecessary rework. This is especially challenging for global teams spread across different time zones, where even a minor miscommunication can slow down critical processes.

Companies like Intel thrive on innovation, but staying ahead means ensuring that teams work together smoothly, no matter where they are. What approach can be taken to solve this?

## Problem 5

In the rapidly evolving world of digital payments, companies like Razorpay have redefined how businesses transact, creating an ecosystem where speed and convenience drive financial interactions. As real-time payments become the norm, the balance between efficiency and security grows increasingly complex, with every transaction flowing through a network of interconnected systems, each with its own vulnerabilities.

The intricate dance of tokenized transactions offers a layer of protection, yet the very mechanisms that safeguard digital payments rely on seamless coordination between multiple entities. In an environment where milliseconds matter, the interplay between encryption, verification, and transaction speed leaves little room for error. A single weak link in this chain could introduce unforeseen risks, where the boundaries of trust and security are tested in ways that are not always immediately visible.

With digital fraud constantly evolving, the challenge lies in fortifying financial ecosystems against emerging threats without disrupting the agility that businesses and consumers expect. How can this issue be resolved?

## Problem 6

The Mahakumbh is one of the largest religious gatherings in the world, drawing millions of devotees to a single location. People come together in faith, moving through crowded pathways, temporary structures, and riverbanks, creating an atmosphere of devotion and unity. However, with such an enormous crowd, even small disturbances can quickly turn into chaos.

When pathways become congested and movement is uncoordinated, panic can spread in seconds, leading to dangerous surges in the crowd. In such moments, traditional crowd management methods often fall short, as authorities struggle to track movement patterns and respond quickly enough to prevent disasters. With so many lives at stake, real-time awareness and rapid intervention are crucial.

How can we use smart hardware-driven solution to solve this issue?
