### Features

- [Animation](https://imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php#bilateral-blur): non-linear, edge-preserving, and noise-reducing smoothing filter.
- [Bilateral Blur](https://imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php#bilateral-blur): non-linear, edge-preserving, and noise-reducing smoothing filter.
- [Color management](https://imagemagick.org/script/color-management.php): accurate color management with color profiles or in lieu of-- built-in gamma compression or expansion as demanded by the colorspace.
- [Color thresholding](https://imagemagick.org/script/color-management.php) force all pixels in the color range to white otherwise black.
- [Command-line processing](https://imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php) utilize ImageMagick from the command-line.
- [Complex text layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_text_layout) bidirectional text support and shaping.
- [Composite](https://imagemagick.org/script/composite.php): overlap one image over another.
- [Connected component labeling](https://imagemagick.org/script/connected-components.php): uniquely label connected regions in an image.
- [Convex hull](https://imagemagick.org/script/convex-hull.php) smallest area convex polygon containing the image foreground objects. In addition, the minimum bounding box and unrotate angle are also generated.
- [Decorate](https://imagemagick.org/Usage/crop/): add a border or frame to an image.
- [Delineate image features](https://imagemagick.org/Usage/transform/#vision): Canny edge detection, mean-shift, Hough lines.
- [Discrete Fourier transform](https://imagemagick.org/Usage/fourier/): implements the forward and inverse [DFT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform).
- [Distributed pixel cache](https://imagemagick.org/script/distribute-pixel-cache.php): offload intermediate pixel storage to one or more remote servers.
- [Draw](https://imagemagick.org/Usage/draw/): add shapes or text to an image.
- [Encipher or decipher an image](https://imagemagick.org/script/cipher.php): convert ordinary images into unintelligible gibberish and back again.
- [Format conversion](https://imagemagick.org/script/convert.php): convert an image from one [format](https://imagemagick.org/script/formats.php) to another (e.g. PNG to JPEG).
- [Generalized pixel distortion](https://imagemagick.org/Usage/distorts/): correct for, or induce image distortions including perspective.
- [Heterogeneous distributed processing](https://imagemagick.org/script/architecture.php#distributed): certain algorithms are OpenCL-enabled to take advantage of speed-ups offered by executing in concert across heterogeneous platforms consisting of CPUs, GPUs, and other processors.
- [High dynamic-range images](https://imagemagick.org/script/high-dynamic-range.php): accurately represent the wide range of intensity levels found in real scenes ranging from the brightest direct sunlight to the deepest darkest shadows.
- [Histogram equalization](https://imagemagick.org/script/clahe.php) use adaptive histogram equalization to improve contrast in images.
- [Image cache](https://imagemagick.org/script/magick-cache.php): secure methods and tools to cache images, image sequences, video, audio or metadata in a local folder.
- [Image calculator](https://imagemagick.org/script/fx.php): apply a mathematical expression to an image or image channels.
- [Image gradients](https://imagemagick.org/script/gradient.php): create a gradual blend of one color whose shape is horizontal, vertical, circular, or elliptical.
- [Image identification](https://imagemagick.org/script/identify.php): describe the format and attributes of an image.
- [ImageMagick on the iPhone](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php#iOS): convert, edit, or compose images on your iPhone.
- [Large image support](https://imagemagick.org/script/architecture.php#tera-pixel): read, process, or write mega-, giga-, or tera-pixel image sizes.
- [Montage](https://imagemagick.org/script/montage.php): juxtapose image thumbnails on an image canvas.
- [Morphology of shapes](https://imagemagick.org/Usage/morphology/): extract features, describe shapes and recognize patterns in images.
- [Motion picture support](https://imagemagick.org/script/motion-picture.php): read and write the common image formats used in digital film work.
- [Multispectral imagery](https://imagemagick.org/script/multispectral-imagery.php): support multispectral imagery up to 64 bands.
- [Noise and color reduction](https://imagemagick.org/Usage/transform/#vision) Kuwahara Filter, mean-shift.
- [Perceptual hash](http://www.fmwconcepts.com/misc_tests/perceptual_hash_test_results_510/index.html): maps visually identical images to the same or similar hash-- useful in image retrieval, authentication, indexing, or copy detection as well as digital watermarking.
- [Special effects](https://imagemagick.org/Usage/blur/): blur, sharpen, threshold, or tint an image.
- [Text & comments](https://imagemagick.org/Usage/text/): insert descriptive or artistic text in an image.
- [Threads of execution support](https://imagemagick.org/script/architecture.php#threads): ImageMagick is thread safe and most internal algorithms are OpenMP-enabled to take advantage of speed-ups offered by multicore processor chips.
- [Transform](https://imagemagick.org/Usage/resize/): resize, rotate, deskew, crop, flip or trim an image.
- [Transparency](https://imagemagick.org/Usage/masking/): render portions of an image invisible.
- [Virtual pixel support](https://imagemagick.org/script/architecture.php#virtual-pixels): convenient access to pixels outside the image region.
