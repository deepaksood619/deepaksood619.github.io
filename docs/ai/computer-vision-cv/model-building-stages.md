# Model Building Stages

## 1. Define the Problem

Clearly define the goal of the project: **to build a CV model that detects aflatoxin contamination levels in corn samples through image analysis**. The contamination levels will be categorized into predefined bands such as 0-30 ppb, 31-50 ppb, etc.

- **Output**: Classification of aflatoxin levels into one of the specified categories.
- **Performance Target**: Achieve at least 80% accuracy in classifying contamination levels.

## 2. Collect and Label Data

The success of a CV model depends heavily on the quality and quantity of data:

- **Image Dataset**: Obtain a dataset of corn images provided by the client, with images labeled based on the aflatoxin contamination levels.
- **Data Labels**: Ensure that each image has a label that specifies the contamination level (in ppb). These will serve as the ground truth for training the model.
- **Data Size**: Ensure the dataset is large enough to prevent overfitting. If the dataset is small, consider techniques like **data augmentation** to artificially increase the dataset size.

## 3. Preprocess the Data

Preprocessing the images is essential to standardize the input data for the model:

- **Normalization**: Scale pixel values to a range of `[0, 1]` or `[-1, 1]` to help the model converge faster.
- **Resizing**: Resize all images to a fixed resolution (e.g., 224x224 pixels) to ensure consistency in input size.
- **Augmentation**: Apply image augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, flipping, zoom, brightness adjustments) to make the model more robust to variations in real-world conditions.
- **Train-Validation Split**: Split the dataset into training and validation sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% validation) to evaluate model performance during development.

## 4. Choose a Model Architecture

For image classification tasks, **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** are the most commonly used architectures:

- **Pre-trained Models (Transfer Learning)**:
    - Use pre-trained models like **ResNet**, **MobileNet**, or **EfficientNet** to leverage knowledge from large datasets like ImageNet. This can reduce training time and improve accuracy.
    - **Transfer Learning**: Fine-tune the pre-trained model on your specific dataset by replacing the final layer(s) to output the aflatoxin contamination categories.
- **Custom CNN Architecture**:
    - If transfer learning isn’t sufficient, a custom CNN architecture can be built. Design layers that fit the complexity of your data, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

## 5. Train the Model

Now that the data is prepared and the model architecture is selected, proceed to training:

- **Loss Function**: Use **categorical cross-entropy** as the loss function since this is a multi-class classification problem.
- **Optimizer**: Use optimizers like **Adam** or **SGD** with momentum to adjust learning rates and improve convergence.
- **Batch Size & Epochs**: Experiment with different batch sizes (e.g., 32, 64) and run multiple epochs (e.g., 50-100 epochs). Monitor overfitting using early stopping techniques.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune hyperparameters like learning rate, dropout rate, and number of layers to optimize performance.

## 6. Evaluate the Model

After training, evaluate the model to ensure it meets the desired performance criteria:

- **Confusion Matrix**: Generate a confusion matrix to analyze how well the model performs across all contamination bands (e.g., 0-30 ppb, 31-50 ppb).
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for each class. For imbalanced datasets, consider using **weighted precision/recall**.
- **Cross-Validation**: Perform **k-fold cross-validation** to ensure that the model generalizes well across different subsets of the data.

## 7. Improve the Model

If the model does not meet the performance goals, several techniques can be used to improve it:

- **Data Augmentation**: Further enhance the dataset by introducing more variability in the training data.
- **Model Regularization**: Use techniques like **dropout**, **batch normalization**, or **L2 regularization** to prevent overfitting.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use methods like **grid search** or **random search** to find optimal values for hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size).
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models (e.g., bagging or boosting) to improve prediction accuracy.

## 8. Test the Model

Once the model is fine-tuned and evaluated, test its performance on a **holdout test set** or new data provided by the client:

- **Validation on New Data**: Use unseen images from the client’s dataset to ensure that the model generalizes well to real-world samples.
- **Performance Metrics Report**: Document the model's final accuracy, confusion matrix, and other performance metrics.

## 9. Deploy the Model (For POC)

For the POC phase, the model will be deployed in a hosted environment (cloud or on-prem):

- **Deploy on Vendor's Environment**: Host the model on a cloud server (e.g., AWS, Azure) where it can accept image inputs and return aflatoxin contamination levels via an API.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Set up tools to monitor inference time, model accuracy, and resource utilization to ensure smooth operation.

## 10. Document and Report Results

After deployment, prepare a comprehensive report to present to the client:

- **POC Results**: Include detailed results of the model’s performance (e.g., accuracy, confusion matrix).
- **Recommendations for Future Phases**: Provide insights on how the model can be scaled and improved further in Phase 2 (e.g., mobile app integration, on-device inference).
