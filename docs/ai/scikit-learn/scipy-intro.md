# Intro

SciPy provides a large menu of libraries for scientific computation, such as integration, interpolation, signal processing, linear algebra, statistics, etc. It is built upon the infrastructure of Numpy

Scikit-learn is a collection of advanced machine-learning algorithms for Python. It also is built upon Numpy and SciPy

## Core numeric libraries

Numpy : numerical computing with powerful numerical arrays objects, and routines to manipulate them

Scipy : high-level numerical routines. Optimization, regression, interpolation

Matplotlib : 2-D visualization, "publication-ready" plots

## Domain-specific packages

- **Mayavi** for 3-D visualization
- **pandas, statsmodels, seaborn** for statistics
- **sumpy** for symbolic computing
- **scikit-image** for image processing
- **scikit-learn** for machine learning
