## Examples of Classification Tasks

Classification tasks are any tasks that have you putting examples into two or more classes. Determining if an image is a cat or dog is a classification task, as is determining what the quality of a bottle of wine is based on features like acidity and alcohol content.

Depending on the classification task at hand, you will want to use different classifiers. For instance, a logistic regression model is best suited for binary classification tasks, even though multiple variable logistic regression models exist.

As you gain more experience with classifiers you will develop a better sense for when to use which classifier. However, a common practice is to instantiate multiple classifiers and compare their performance against one another, then select the classifier which performs the best.
