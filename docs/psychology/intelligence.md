# Intelligence

Howard Gardner, a psychologist & professor at Harvard University, first introduced the concept of 8 types of human intelligence in his 1983 book Frames of Mind.

Each type is said to represent different ways of how a person best processes information

Intelligence is real, important, largely heritable, and not particularly changeable -- Scott Young

- It shows strong heritability, with the [g-factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics)) maybe being as much as 85% heritable.

## Emotional Intelligence (EQ)

Emotional Intelligence (EQ or EI) can be defined asthe ability to understand, manage, and effectively express one's own feelings, as well as engage and navigate successfully with those of others.

EQ can evolve and increase with our desire to learn and grow.

- Reduce negative emotions
- Stay cool and manage stress
- Express difficult emotions
    - One method to consider when needing to express difficult emotions is the XYZ technique -I feel X when you do Y in situation Z.

Avoid using sentences that begin with "you" and followed by accusation or judgment, such as "you are...," "you should...," or "you need to... ."

- Stay proactive, not reactive
- Bounce back from adversity
- Express intimate emotions

"the more EQ the better" is not true. Reality: EQ is like sunshine - **you want a good amount of it but too much will give you skin cancer.**
