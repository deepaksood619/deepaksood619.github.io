## Thoughts about people

Almost everyone in this world is idiot and have nothing to contribute, but never say this to them... Always say them okay and ignore instead of demeaning him/her, because they cannot handle it

Don't say bad to people whom you don't give money, only if they are dependent on you, and they are fearful you can say something

Otherwise show disappointment

The story of my experiments with truth

- Despite the disapproval of his caste, Gandhi went to England to study law
- Seeking professional experience, Gandhi went to South Africa and saw the effects of racism firsthand
- In addition to his legal work, Gandhi was commited to public service and studying religion
- Before spreading his message of equality in India, Gandhi's southern African work continued in Natal
- After helping the wounded in the Boer war, Gandhi stayed humble and informed in India
- Gandhi was committed to both nonviolence and celibacy
- Gandhi continued to fight for Indians in South Africa and launched a new form of nonviolent resistance
- Upon the start of WWI, Gandhi returned to India, where he continued to fight injustice
- Gandhi suspended satyagraha when it triggered violence, but his noncooperation resolution was ultimately passed
