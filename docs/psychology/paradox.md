# Paradox

[**Omnipotence paradox**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnipotence_paradox "Omnipotence paradox"): Can an [omnipotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnipotent "Omnipotent") being create a rock too heavy for itself to lift?

## Logic

- [**Barbershop paradox**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbershop_paradox "Barbershop paradox"): The supposition that, "if one of two simultaneous assumptions leads to a contradiction, the other assumption is also disproved" leads to paradoxical consequences. Not to be confused with the [Barber paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barber_paradox "Barber paradox").
- [**What the Tortoise Said to Achilles**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_the_Tortoise_Said_to_Achilles "What the Tortoise Said to Achilles"): If a presumption needs to be made that a specific result can be deduced from premises, then the result can never be deduced. An inference rule, which is valid (or not), cannot be a premise, which is true (or false), otherwise one has an infinite regress. Also known as _Carroll's paradox_ and is not to be confused with the "Achilles and the tortoise" paradox by [Zeno of Elea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Elea "Zeno of Elea").
- [**Catch-22**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22_(logic) "Catch-22 (logic)"): A situation in which someone is in need of something that can only be had by not being in need of it. A soldier who wants to be declared insane to avoid combat is deemed not insane for that very reason and will therefore not be declared insane.
- [**Drinker paradox**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinker_paradox "Drinker paradox"): In any pub there is a customer such that if that customer is drinking, everybody in the pub is drinking.
- [**Paradox of free choice**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_free_choice "Paradox of free choice"): Disjunction introduction poses a problem for modal inferences, permitting arbitrary modal statements to be inferred.
- [**Paradox of entailment**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_entailment "Paradox of entailment"): Inconsistent premises always make an argument valid.
- [**Lottery paradox**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lottery_paradox "Lottery paradox"): If there is one winning ticket in a large lottery, it is reasonable to believe of any particular lottery ticket that it is not the winning ticket, but it is not reasonable to believe that no lottery ticket will win.
- [**Raven paradox**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven_paradox "Raven paradox"): (or Hempel's Ravens): Observing a green apple increases the likelihood of all ravens being black.
- [**Ross' paradox**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross%27_paradox "Ross' paradox"): Disjunction introduction poses a problem for imperative inference by seemingly permitting arbitrary imperatives to be inferred.
- [**Temperature paradox**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature_paradox "Temperature paradox"): If the temperature is 90 and the temperature is rising, that would seem to entail that 90 is rising.
- [**Unexpected hanging paradox**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unexpected_hanging_paradox "Unexpected hanging paradox"): The day of the hanging will be a surprise, so it cannot happen at all, so it will be a surprise. The _surprise examination_ and [Bottle Imp paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bottle_Imp "The Bottle Imp") use similar logic.

### Self-reference

These paradoxes have in common a contradiction arising from either [self-reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-reference "Self-reference") or [circular reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_reference "Circular reference"), in which several statements refer to each other in a way that following some of the references leads back to the starting point.

    - [**Card paradox**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_paradox "Card paradox"): "The next statement is true. The previous statement is false." A variant of the liar paradox in which neither of the sentences employs (direct) self-reference, instead this is a case of circular reference.

    - [**Yablo's paradox**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yablo%27s_paradox "Yablo's paradox"): An ordered infinite sequence of sentences, each of which says that all following sentences are false. While constructed to avoid self-reference, there is no consensus whether it relies on self-reference or not.
- [**Opposite Day**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposite_Day "Opposite Day"): "It is opposite day today." Therefore, it is not opposite day, but if you say it is a normal day it would be considered a normal day, which contradicts the fact that it has previously been stated that it is an opposite day.
- [**Richard's paradox**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard%27s_paradox "Richard's paradox"): We appear to be able to use simple English to define a decimal expansion in a way that is self-contradictory.

### Vagueness

- [**Ship of Theseus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus "Ship of Theseus"): It seems like one can replace any component of a ship, and it is still the same ship. So they can replace them all, one at a time, and it is still the same ship. However, they can then take all the original pieces, and assemble them into a ship. That, too, is the same ship they began with.

- [**Low birth weight paradox**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_birth_weight_paradox "Low birth weight paradox"): Low birth weight and mothers who smoke contribute to a higher mortality rate. Babies of smokers have lower average birth weight, but low birth weight babies born to smokers have a lower mortality rate than other low birth weight babies. This is a special case of Simpson's paradox.
- [**Simpson's paradox**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox "Simpson's paradox"), or the [**Yule-Simpson effect**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yule%E2%80%93Simpson_effect "Yule-Simpson effect"): A trend that appears in different groups of data disappears when these groups are combined, and the reverse trend appears for the aggregate data.

But [Cantor's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_theorem "Cantor's theorem") proves that power sets are strictly greater than the sets they are constructed from.
