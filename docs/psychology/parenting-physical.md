## Medicine

- [12 Tricks to Get Your Toddler to Take Medicine](https://www.whattoexpect.com/toddler-health/get-toddler-to-take-medicine.aspx)
- Laying a child down and forcing them to take medicine while crying is extremely dangerous due to the high risk of choking. A crying, struggling toddler can easily inhale liquid medicine into their lungs, which can be life-threatening. Medical professionals strongly advise against this method.
- **The proper technique**
	- **Keep the child upright:** Always have the child in a seated or upright position, such as on your lap.
	- **Use a syringe:** Use a plastic oral syringe to control the flow and amount of liquid.
	- **Aim for the cheek:** Slowly squirt the medicine into the side of the mouth, aiming for the cheek pouch between the gums and cheek. This bypasses the taste buds and allows them to swallow more easily.
	- **Hold the mouth closed:** Gently hold the child's mouth closed and stroke under their chin to encourage them to swallow.
- **Strategies for a resistant toddler**
	- **Offer small choices:** Give the child a sense of control by letting them choose the syringe, which cup to use, or what fun reward they will get afterward.
	- **Mask the flavor:** Ask your pharmacist if it's safe to mix the medicine into a small amount of a favorite food, like applesauce, yogurt, or chocolate syrup. Do not mix it into an entire bottle or large dish, as the child must eat the whole portion to get the full dose.
	- **Numb the taste buds:** Let the child suck on a popsicle or ice cube beforehand to temporarily numb their taste buds.
	- **Make it a game:** Distract the child by making funny faces or singing songs. Some parents have success playing pretend, letting the child give "medicine" to a stuffed animal first.
	- **Have two adults help:** If the child is truly struggling, have one adult hold the child calmly in their lap while the other administers the medicine.
	- **Stay calm and positive:** Your child can sense your frustration. Staying calm and cheerful can make the process less stressful for everyone.
	- **Reward good behavior:** After they take the medicine, praise them and offer a non-food reward like a sticker or a hug.

- suppository
	- A suppository is a solid medication inserted into a body cavity (such as the rectum or vagina) where it dissolves to release medication for local or systemic effects. They are used to treat conditions like constipation, hemorrhoids, and fever, or to deliver medicine when a person cannot swallow or absorb oral medications. The medication is designed to be absorbed into the bloodstream through the mucous membranes in the rectal or vaginal wall.

## Speech Delay

### Solutions

- Reading with kids
- Give child time to respond
- No screen time
- Playing with kid

### Medical Reasons

- Leucovorin, also known as calcium folinate and leucovorin calcium, is **a type of vitamin B9, or folate**. Folate, which is naturally found in certain foods, helps the body make healthy red blood cells and is important for overall brain function.
- A Folate Receptor Antibody Test (FRAT®) is a blood test that detects autoantibodies to folate receptor alpha (FRα), a protein vital for transporting folate (vitamin B9) into the brain. The presence of these autoantibodies suggests impaired folate transport, leading to cerebral folate deficiency (CFD), and can be associated with neurodevelopmental disorders like autism, unexplained neurological symptoms, or certain neuropsychiatric conditions. Treatment may involve alternative folate forms, such as folinic acid, to bypass the blocked receptors.
- Infants and children with symptoms of cerebral folate deficiency or developmental delays.
- **cerebral folate deficiency (CFD)**, a lack of folate in the brain, can cause a child to be nonverbal. CFD can be caused by genetic mutations or autoimmune factors like folate receptor antibodies that block folate from entering the brain. Folate is crucial for brain development and neurotransmitter function, and a lack of it leads to developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and speech difficulties, including being nonverbal. Treatment with the active form of folate, such as folinic acid, can improve communication in children with CFD.
