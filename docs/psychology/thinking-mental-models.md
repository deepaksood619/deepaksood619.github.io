### Probabilistic Thinking

Probabilistic thinking is essentially trying to estimate, using some tools of math and logic, the likelihood of any specific outcome coming to pass. It is one of the best tools we have to improve the accuracy of our decisions. In a world where each moment is determined by an infinitely complex set of factors, probabilistic thinking helps us identify the most likely outcomes. When we know these our decisions can be more precise and effective.

### Gradually, and then suddenly

The quote is from Ernest Hemingway.

Combined two important systems thinking models - the Iceberg Model and Pace Layers framework.

## Systems Thinking

[Thinking in systems](../book-summaries/thinking-in-systems)

"Systems thinking is a way of seeing the world as a series of **interconnected** and **interdependent** systems rather than lots of independent parts. As a thinking tool, it seeks to oppose the **reductionist view** - the idea that a system can be understood by the sum of its isolated parts - and replace it with **expansionism**, the view that everything is part of a larger whole and that the connections between all elements are critical."

- [Systems Thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking) - "By taking the overall system as well as its parts into account systems thinking is designed to avoid potentially contributing to further development of unintended consequences." (related:[causal loop diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_dynamics#Causal_loop_diagrams);[stock and flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_and_flow);[Le Chatelier's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Chatelier%27s_principle#Effect_of_a_catalyst), [hysteresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis#In_biology) - "the time-based dependence of a system's output on present and past inputs."; "Can't see the forest for the trees.")

- Connection circles
- Balancing feedback loop
- Reinforcing feedback loop
    - Ex - **Compound Interest** (The more money you have in the bank, the more you earn on interest. That money is added to your balance and so you earn on interest even more.)

- **Decision Making**
    - Confidence determines speed vs. quality
        - Is your confidence in the problem importance low? Focus on speed.
        - Is your confidence in the problem and the solution high? Focus on quality.
        - Is your confidence in the problem importance high, but low in the solution? Balance both speed and quality.

        - Ex - living an hour away from work → need to buy a car → spending two hours of each day in a car

- **First principles -** Break down complex problems into basic elements and create innovative solutions from there.

- **Abstraction laddering -** Frame your problem better with different levels of abstraction.

- **Inversion -** Approach a problem from a different point of view.

[Arguing from First Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle) - "A first principle is a basic, foundational, self-evident proposition or assumption that cannot be deduced from any other proposition or assumption." (related:[dimensionality reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction);[orthogonality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality); "Reasonable minds can disagree" if underlying premises differ.)

## First Principles Thinking

1. Clarifying your thinking and explaining the origins of your ideas (Why do I think this? What exactly do I think?)
2. Challenging assumptions (How do I know this is true? What if I thought the opposite?)
3. Looking for evidence (How can I back this up? What are the sources?)
4. Considering alternative perspectives (What might others think? How do I know I am correct?)
5. Examining consequences and implications (What if I am wrong? What are the consequences if I am?)
6. Questioning the original questions (Why did I think that? Was I correct? What conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?)

### Optionality

**At the most basic level, optionality just means having lots of options.**

If you develop a skill with many possible job opportunities, you have more optionality than someone who develops a skill that only has one or two job opportunities.

The advantage of optionality is that as the world grows increasingly difficult to predict, you can thrive in spite of not knowing the future.

You simply see what happens and exercise whichever option turns out to be most advantageous.

## Black and White Thinking by Kevin Dutton

The burden of a binary brain in a complex world

- Today, life's rarely black and white, but often shades of gray
- Too many alternatives can quickly overwhelm the brain. Similarly, having too few choices is a path to stereotyping, hatred, and militancy

## The Fallacy of Affirming the Consequent

Problem: As a logical claim, it doesn't work

Just because a prediction turns out to be true, does not prove that the theory that made the prediction is true.

Reason: False hypotheses can make true predictions

## Counterfactual thinking

Counterfactual thinking is a concept in psychology that involves the human tendency to create possible alternatives to life events that have already occurred; something that is contrary to what actually happened. Counterfactual thinking is, as it states: "counter to the facts". These thoughts consist of the "What if?" and the "If only..." that occur when thinking of how things could have turned out differently. Counterfactual thoughts include things that - in the present - now could never happen in reality because they solely pertain to events that have occurred in the past.

#### Upward counterfactual thinking

Silver vs bronze medalist

Upward counterfactuals are **thoughts about how the situation could have been better**. These kinds of thoughts tend to make people feel dissatisfied and unhappy; however, upward counterfactuals are the kind of thoughts that allow people to think about how they can do better in the future.
