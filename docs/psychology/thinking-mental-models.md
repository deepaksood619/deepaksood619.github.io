you methodically [break down problems](https://forge.medium.com/the-500-year-old-piece-of-advice-that-will-change-your-life-1e580f115731) and solve them piece by piece, rather than worrying, relying on past assumptions, or shrugging in absolute cluelessness.

- Probablistic Thinking
- **Gradually, and then suddenly**

The quote is from Ernest Hemingway. The graphic is from Gautam John, a subscriber, who combined two important systems thinking models - the Iceberg Model and Pace Layers framework.

## Systems Thinking

[Thinking in systems](../book-summaries/thinking-in-systems)

"Systems thinking is a way of seeing the world as a series of **interconnected** and **interdependent** systems rather than lots of independent parts. As a thinking tool, it seeks to oppose the **reductionist view** --- the idea that a system can be understood by the sum of its isolated parts - and replace it with **expansionism**, the view that everything is part of a larger whole and that the connections between all elements are critical."

- [Systems Thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking)--- "By taking the overall system as well as its parts into account systems thinking is designed to avoid potentially contributing to further development of unintended consequences." (related:[causal loop diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_dynamics#Causal_loop_diagrams);[stock and flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_and_flow);[Le Chatelier's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Chatelier%27s_principle#Effect_of_a_catalyst), [hysteresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis#In_biology) - "the time-based dependence of a system's output on present and past inputs."; "Can't see the forest for the trees.")

- Iceberg Model
- Connection circles
- Balancing feedback loop
- Reinforcing feedback loop
  - Ex - **Compound Interest** (The more money you have in the bank, the more you earn on interest. That money is added to your balance and so you earn on interest even more.)

- **Decision Making**
  - Confidence determines speed vs. quality
    - Is your confidence in the problem importance low? Focus on speed.
    - Is your confidence in the problem and the solution high? Focus on quality.
    - Is your confidence in the problem importance high, but low in the solution? Balance both speed and quality.
  - Second order thinking
    - Ex - living an hour away from work → need to buy a car → spending two hours of each day in a car
  - Hard choice model
  - Decision matrix
- **Problem Solving**
  - Issue trees

- First principles

Break down complex problems into basic elements and create innovative solutions from there.

- Abstraction laddering

Frame your problem better with different levels of abstraction.

- Inversion

Approach a problem from a different point of view.

[Arguing from First Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle)--- "A first principle is a basic, foundational, self-evident proposition or assumption that cannot be deduced from any other proposition or assumption." (related:[dimensionality reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction);[orthogonality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality); "Reasonable minds can disagree" if underlying premises differ.)

## First Principles Thinking

1. Clarifying your thinking and explaining the origins of your ideas (Why do I think this? What exactly do I think?)
2. Challenging assumptions (How do I know this is true? What if I thought the opposite?)
3. Looking for evidence (How can I back this up? What are the sources?)
4. Considering alternative perspectives (What might others think? How do I know I am correct?)
5. Examining consequences and implications (What if I am wrong? What are the consequences if I am?)
6. Questioning the original questions (Why did I think that? Was I correct? What conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?)

## Black and White Thinking by Kevin Dutton

The burden of a binary brain in a complex world

- Today, life's rarely black and white, but often shades of gray
- Too many alternatives can quickly overwhelm the brain. Similarly, having too few choices is a path to stereotyping, hatred, and militancy

## The Fallacy of Affirming the Consequent

Problem: As a logical claim, it doesn't work

Just because a prediction turns out to be true, does not prove that the theory that made the prediction is true.

Reason: False hypotheses can make true predictions
