# Travelling

Every weekend shouldn't be a party
Once a year trip plan

Slow thoughtful life, rather than party life

## Case Against Travel

[G. K. Chesterton](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/07/07/the-back-of-the-world) wrote that "travel narrows the mind." [Ralph Waldo Emerson](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/ralph-waldo-emerson) called travel "a fool’s paradise." Socrates and Immanuel Kant-arguably the two greatest philosophers of all time-voted with their feet, rarely leaving their respective home towns of Athens and Königsberg. But the greatest hater of travel, ever, was the Portuguese writer [Fernando Pessoa](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/09/04/fernando-pessoas-disappearing-act), whose wonderful "[Book of Disquiet](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Disquiet-Penguin-Classics/dp/0141183047?ots=1&tag=thneyo0f-20&linkCode=w50)" crackles with outrage:

> I abhor new ways of life and unfamiliar places. . . . The idea of travelling nauseates me. . . . Ah, let those who don’t exist travel! . . . Travel is for those who cannot feel. . . . Only extreme poverty of the imagination justifies having to move around to feel.

Although people like to talk about their travels, few of us like to listen to them.

Pessoa, Emerson, and Chesterton believed that travel, far from putting us in touch with humanity, divorced us from it. Travel turns us into the worst version of ourselves while convincing us that we’re at our best. Call this the traveller’s delusion.

**A tourist is a temporarily leisured person who voluntarily visits a place away from home for the purpose of experiencing a change.** This definition is taken from the opening of "[Hosts and Guests](https://www.amazon.com/Hosts-Guests-Anthropology-Valene-Smith/dp/0812212800?ots=1&tag=thneyo0f-20&linkCode=w50)," the classic academic volume on the anthropology of tourism. The last phrase is crucial: touristic travel exists for the sake of change. But what, exactly, gets changed? Here is a telling observation from the concluding chapter of the same book: "Tourists are less likely to borrow from their hosts than their hosts are from them, thus precipitating a chain of change in the host community." **We go to experience a change, but end up inflicting change on others.**

Tourism is marked by its locomotive character. "I _went_ to France." O.K., but what did you do there? "I _went_ to the Louvre." O.K., but what did you do there? "I _went_ to see the ‘Mona Lisa.’ " That is, before quickly moving on: apparently, many people spend just fifteen seconds looking at the "Mona Lisa." It’s locomotion all the way down.

A couple from Iowa driving around Mexico. They are enjoying the trip, but are a bit dissatisfied by the usual sights. They get lost, drive for hours on a rocky mountain road, and eventually, "in a tiny valley not even marked on the map," stumble upon a village celebrating a religious festival. Watching the villagers dance, the tourists finally have "an authentic sight, a sight which is charming, quaint, picturesque, unspoiled." Yet they still feel some dissatisfaction. Back home in Iowa, they gush about the experience to an ethnologist friend: You should have been there! You must come back with us! When the ethnologist does, in fact, return with them, "the couple do not watch the goings-on; instead they watch the ethnologist! Their highest hope is that their friend should find the dance interesting." They need him to "**certify their experience as genuine.**"

**Travel is a boomerang. It drops you right where you started.**

If you think that this doesn’t apply to you-that your own travels are magical and profound, with effects that deepen your values, expand your horizons, render you a true citizen of the globe, and so on-note that this phenomenon can’t be assessed first-personally. Pessoa, Chesterton, Percy, and Emerson were all aware that travellers _tell themselves_ they’ve changed, but you can’t rely on introspection to detect a delusion. So cast your mind, instead, to any friends who are soon to set off on summer adventures. In what condition do you expect to find them when they return? They may speak of their travel as though it were transformative, a "once in a lifetime" experience, but will you be able to notice a difference in their behavior, their beliefs, their moral compass? Will there be any difference at all?

Travel is fun, so it is not mysterious that we like it. What _is_ mysterious is why we imbue it with a vast significance, an aura of virtue. If a vacation is merely the pursuit of unchanging change, an embrace of nothing, why insist on its meaning?

**Socrates said that philosophy is a preparation for death. For everyone else, there’s travel.**
