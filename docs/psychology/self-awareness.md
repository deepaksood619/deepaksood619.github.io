# Self Awareness

It is the ability to see ourselves clearly, to understand who we are, how other see us, and how we fit into the world

Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom. -- Aristotle

There are three things extremely hard: steel, a diamond, and to know one's self -- Benjamin Franklin

Why we're not as self-aware as we think, and how seeing ourselves clearly helps us succeed at work and in life

- Self-awareness is the ability to understand who we are and what others think of us, and it consists of seven insights
    - Internal self-awareness - knowing ourselves, being conscious of our likes and dislikes, our ambitions, our place in the environment and our impact on other people
    - External self-awareness - understanding how other people see us
    - Insights
        - Values
        - Passions
        - Aspirations
        - Fit - which environment will make us happiest, keep us engaged and enable us to thrive
        - Patterns - the consistent behaviors that make up our personality
        - Reactions - emotional and physical behaviors we exhibit in certain circumstances
        - Impact - undestanding how our own behavior affects others
- Inner and societal roadblocks disrupt the journey to self-awareness
    - knowledge blindness
    - emotional blindness
    - behavior blindness
- Introspection isn't a sure path to insight, so we need to do it right
    - flexible mindset
    - rumination - introspection's evil twin

Fixation on our anxieties, weaknesses and insecurities

- Three mindfulness techniques can increase internal self-awareness
    - reframing - looking at the bigger picture of your experiences
    - comparing and contrasting - noticing how our thoughts, feelings and behaviors have remained the same or changed over time
    - daily check-in - daily 5 mins reflect on what went well and what could have been better.
- Ask for feedback
- Reacting to feedback
    - receive, reflect and respond (3R model)
- self-aware team
    - objectives, progress, process, assumptions and individual contributions
    - role model (authentic leadership), psychological safety net, ongoing (growth mind-set)
- Three kinds of delusional people
    - Lost cause
    - Aware don't care - knows exactly how their behavior impacts, others, but couldn't care less
    - Nudgable
- **Social Media - Rather than a Meformer, become an Informer**

Meformer - post information that isn't immediately related to themselves

## Ontology

Ontology is the [philosophical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy)[study](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/study) of [being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being). More broadly, it studies concepts that directly relate to being, in particular [becoming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becoming_(philosophy)), [existence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence), [reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality), as well as the basic [categories of being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_of_being) and their relations.Traditionally listed as a part of the major branch of philosophy known as [metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics), ontology often deals with questions concerning what [entities](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/entity) exist or may be said to exist and how such entities may be grouped, related within a [hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy), and subdivided according to similarities and differences.

Ontology has two main meanings

- **a philosophical one**, referring to the study of the nature of being, existence, and reality
- **a more practical one in computer science and information management**, meaning a rigorous and hierarchical structure of knowledge that defines entities and their relationships within a specific domain.

In philosophy, ontology asks fundamental questions about what exists, its fundamental properties, and how different things are classified.

In computer science, it's a formal way to organize and represent information, creating a shared understanding of a subject area.

### Philosophical Ontology

- Definition: The branch of philosophy that studies the nature of existence, or "being". It explores concepts like reality, existence itself, and the fundamental categories of things that exist.
- Questions asked: Does God exist? Do numbers exist? How do emotions relate to physical objects? What are the basic building blocks of the world?
- Examples: Dividing entities into concrete (like trees) and abstract (like ideas).

### Computer Science/Information Management Ontology

- Definition: A formal and structured representation of knowledge in a particular subject area. It's a hierarchical list of concepts and their relationships within that domain.
- Purpose: To define terms, concepts, and the connections between them, ensuring a consistent understanding across different users and systems.
- Examples: A marketing ontology might define concepts like "customer," "product," and "campaign," and show how they are related, such as a customer purchasing a product.
- In essence, the term "ontology" can refer to a deep, abstract philosophical inquiry into what truly exists, or a practical, structured system for organizing and defining knowledge in a specific field.
