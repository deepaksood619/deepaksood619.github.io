# Self Awareness

## It is the ability to see ourselves clearly, to understand who we are, how other see us, and how we fit into the world

Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom. -- Aristotle

There are three things extremely hard: steel, a diamond, and to know one's self -- Benjamin Franklin

Why we're not as self-aware as we think, and how seeing ourselves clearly helps us succeed at work and in life

- Self-awareness is the ability to understand who we are and what others think of us, and it consists of seven insights
  - Internal self-awareness - knowing ourselves, being conscious of our likes and dislikes, our ambitions, our place in the environment and our impact on other people
  - External self-awareness - understanding how other people see us
  - Insights
    - Values
    - Passions
    - Aspirations
    - Fit - which environment will make us happiest, keep us engaged and enable us to thrive
    - Patterns - the consistent behaviors that make up our personality
    - Reactions - emotional and physical behaviors we exhibit in certain circumstances
    - Impact - undestanding how our own behavior affects others
- Inner and societal roadblocks disrupt the journey to self-awareness
  - knowledge blindness
  - emotional blindness
  - behavior blindness
- Introspection isn't a sure path to insight, so we need to do it right
  - flexible mindset
  - rumination - introspection's evil twin

Fixation on our anxieties, weaknesses and insecurities

- Three mindfulness techniques can increase internal self-awareness
  - reframing - looking at the bigger picture of your experiences
  - comparing and contrasting - noticing how our thoughts, feelings and behaviors have remained the same or changed over time
  - daily check-in - daily 5 mins reflect on what went well and what could have been better.
- Ask for feedback
- Reacting to feedback
  - receive, reflect and respond (3R model)
- self-aware team
  - objectives, progress, process, assumptions and individual contributions
  - role model (authentic leadership), psychological safety net, ongoing (growth mind-set)
- Three kinds of delusional people
  - Lost cause
  - Aware don't care - knows exactly how their behavior impacts, others, but couldn't care less
  - Nudgable
- **Social Media - Rather than a Meformer, become an Informer**

Meformer - post information that isn't immediately related to themselves

## Ontology

Ontologyis the [philosophical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy)[study](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/study) of [being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being). More broadly, it studies concepts that directly relate to being, in particular [becoming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becoming_(philosophy)), [existence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence), [reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality), as well as the basic [categories of being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_of_being) and their relations.Traditionally listed as a part of the major branch of philosophy known as [metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics), ontology often deals with questions concerning what [entities](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/entity) exist or may be said to exist and how such entities may be grouped, related within a [hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy), and subdivided according to similarities and differences.
