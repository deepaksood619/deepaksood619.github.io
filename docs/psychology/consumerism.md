### [Conspicuous Consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspicuous_consumption)

The spending of money on and the acquiring of luxury goods and services to publicly display economic power." (related: [Veblen goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_good) - "types of luxury goods, such as expensive wines, jewellery, fashion-designer handbags, and luxury cars, which are in demand because of the high prices asked for them.")

A classic example of this would be a luxury watch: A Rolex isn't better at telling the time than a cheap Casio -- but a Rolex signals something about its owner's economic power and thus their social standing.
