## Relationship Quotes

Marrying well makes everything easier

Trevor Noah: The way my mother always explained it, the traditional man wants a woman to be subservient, but he never falls in love with subservient women. He's attracted to independent women. "He's like an exotic bird collector," she said. "He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage."

It's okay to dislike someone, or even dislike someone for no reason. But it's not okay to disrespect, degrade, and humiliate that person

Find a partner who is ready to build with you

It is not about finding perfection in another person, it is about realizing when you come across an undeniable connection that nourishes your being and matches the type of support you are looking for. Getting lost in the idea of perfection is a hindrance. Being with someone who is committed to going through the ups and downs of life together is truly priceless

When two people embrace their imperfections and commit to growing into better versions of themselves, it will naturally enhance the happiness they share in the relationship

Double down on your best relationship

It's the investment with the highest return

It's easier to destroy a relationship than build one

_patri mile na mile, sleep schedule zaroor milna chahiye_ (your sleep schedule being compatible is more important than your astrological charts being compatible!)

The secret to feeling great about yourself is not to be found in searching for people who are less than you and then show yourself superior to them, but in searching for people who are more than you and then show yourself worthy of their company

A man's character is seen when he has everything. A woman's character is tested and seen when her men has nothing.

I would recognize you in total darkness, were you mute and I deaf. I would recognize you in another lifetime entirely, in different bodies, different times. And I would love you in all of this, until the very last star in the sky burnt out into oblivion."

"A good marriage is one in which each spouse secretly thinks he or she got the better deal, and this is true also of our friendships."

What most people call love today is little more than a mutual benefit scheme. Love is an unconditional sweetness of emotion. -- Sadhguru

What you need to make your marriage successful is not the perfect person. What you need is absolute integrity. -- Sadhguru

The idea of marriage is to multiply the joy. Multiplying misery is a crime against Humanity. -- Sadhguru

If one spouse commutes longer than 45 minutes, that couple is 40% more likely to get divorced

There is really no such thing as conditional love and unconditional love -- there are conditions, and there is love. -- Sadhguru

Love is not a noun, but a verb. It's a thing you do.

Always give value before you ask for value.

Not taking things personally is a superpower.

Entrepreneur Cindy Gallop on how to build a successful business:

"There is a formula for success in business, and it goes like this: You set out to find the very best talent in the marketplace, and then give them a compelling and inspirational vision of what you want them to achieve for you and the company. Then you empower them to achieve those goals using their own skills and talents in any way they choose. If, at the same time, you demonstrate how enormously you value them, not just through compensation, but also verbally, every single day, and if you enable that talent to share in the profit that they help create for you, you'll be successful. It's so simple, and virtually nobody does it, because it requires a high-trust working environment, and most business environments are low-trust. In order to own the future of your business, you have to design it around trust."

The less rigid your personality, the more powerful your presence. -- Sadhguru

Having expectations of others means you are trying to fix their lives. Fix your own life -- that is freedom. -- Sadhguru

Love is not about somebody. Love is not some kind of act. Love is the way you are.

I want to live in a world where friends feel **ok** to drop by each other's home unannounced

## 7 secrets to a healthy relationship

1. Appreciate your partner's efforts - If you want your relationship to work, constantly remind yourself that the other is more significant than you.
2. Learn to respect personal space
3. Express your emotions
4. Discuss your concerns
5. Trust your partner
6. Share your passions
7. Avoid blame game

## Gottman Ratio - 5 to 1 (can be used for habits also, for every one slip, do right 5/4 times)

This means that for every one negative feeling or interaction between partners, there must be five positive feelings or interactions. Stable and happy couples share more positive feelings and actions than negative ones. Unhappy couples tend to have more negative feelings and actions than positive ones. Partners who criticize each other, provide constant negative feedback, aren't supportive of each other, don't demonstrate affection or appreciation, or behave uninterested in their partner are in relationships that are out of balance.

## The 5 love languages

1. Positive, uplifting words of affirmation

   - Praise is the sweetest of all sounds
   - Verbal compliments

       - appreciate their sense of humor
       - look great in a new outfit
       - praise their ability to care for your children

2. Spend quality time with your partner
3. Gifts are visual symbols of love and surprising your partner with regular presents, regardless of their monteary value, is a great way to show affection
4. Doing useful things for your partner is a common way to express love
5. Physical touch is a powerful way to show your love
6. Greatest gift - Helping your partner through hard times (simply standing by your partner during rough periods)
