## Biology

- Limbic system (amygdala & hipocampus) processing information and decision making
- The brain is divided into four main lobes: the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and occipital lobe.

  - The frontal lobe is responsible for movement, problem solving, judgment, and planning. It also plays a role in personality and emotional expression.
  - The parietal lobe is responsible for sensation, such as touch, temperature, and pain. It also plays a role in spatial awareness and navigation.
  - The temporal lobe is responsible for auditory processing, memory, and language.
  - The occipital lobe is responsible for vision.
