# Listening

When we listen, we hear someone into existence -- Laurie Buchanan, PhD

[4 things all great listeners know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3ku5nx4tMU)

1. Removing any distractions, especially phones
2. Trying not to interrupt, asking open ended questions when in break
3. Focusing on the present moment, asking the other if you miss the details
4. Don’t be afraid of silence, both can use those moments to think a more thoughtful conversation
