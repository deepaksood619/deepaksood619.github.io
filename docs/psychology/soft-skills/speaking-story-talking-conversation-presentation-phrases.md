### 7 Deadly Sins of Speaking (Why Nobody Wants to Listen to You)

All of us speak. BUT very few are really heard closely and carefully.

Here are seven deadly sins of speaking - the reasons why nobody wants to listen to you:

1. **Gossip -** The person gossiping about someone behind their back will very certainly gossip about us when we’re not around.
2. **Judging -** It’s hard to keep a conversation with someone who’s judgmental. You don’t know her/him, you just know a very small part of her/his story.
3. **Negativity -** Someone who brings negative perspective to every facet of life, they are the real energy-suckers, making everyone just as sad and cynic as they are.
4. **Complaining -** Complaining is viral misery. It does not spread sunshine and lightness in the world. It’s a way of handing our control to others and fate.
5. **Excuses -** Some people have a blame-thrower. They just pass it on to everybody else, and never take responsibility for their action. It’s hard to listen to such people.
6. **Lying -** NOBODY wants to listen to people who are lying.
7. **Dogmatism -** The confusion of facts and opinions. People who bombard others with their opinions as if they were facts, it’s difficult to keep up with such individuals.

If you want people to listen to you carefully when you speak, it’s essential that you eliminate these sins from your communication.

Be honest in what you say. Show your authenticity. Have integrity in your words. And, of course, make sure what you’re saying reflects love and care.

Words are very powerful. They can start a war. They can break hearts. They can bring hope.

When speaking (or writing), use them to spread positivity and joy with others. Use them to make others feel good and interested and happy. This is the simplest way to really make a difference in the world.
