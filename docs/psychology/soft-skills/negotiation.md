# Negotiation Tips

You want leverage.

- The person who creates more value has leverage.
- The person who can walk away has leverage.
- The person who is irreplaceable has leverage.
- The person who has a second option has leverage.
- The person who knows the numbers has leverage.
- The person who everyone likes and wants to work with has leverage.
- The person who asks for more, gets more.

And finally, most negotiations are not one-time affairs. The person people continue to like at the end of this negotiation is in a better position for the next one.
