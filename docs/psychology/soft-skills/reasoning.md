# Reasoning

[Reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasoning) is the capacity for [consciously](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness) making sense of things, applying [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic), for establishing and verifying [facts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact), and changing or justifying practices, institutions, and [beliefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beliefs) based on new or existing information. It is closely associated with such characteristically [human](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human) activities as [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy), [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science), [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language), [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), and [art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art), and is normally considered to be a definitive characteristic of [human nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nature).

## Circular Reasoning (Begging the question)

Where the reason given for a conclusion assumes the conclusion is true, rather than explaining why it's true

Ex - Witch hunt should be encouraged because there is a need for witch hunts

When you run into trouble is when you assume that an opinion or current state of affairs, because it's so familiar or long-lasting, is a fact, when really it's an assumption.

## Logical Reasoning

Two kinds oflogical reasoningcan be distinguished in addition to formal deduction: induction and abduction. Given a precondition or [premise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premise), a conclusion or [logical consequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_consequence) and a rule or [material conditional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_conditional) that implies theconclusiongiven theprecondition, one can explain the following.

- [Deductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning) determines whether the truth of aconclusioncan be determined for thatrule, based solely on the truth of the premises. Example: "When it rains, things outside get wet. The grass is outside, therefore: when it rains, the grass gets wet."[Mathematical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic) and [philosophical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_logic) are commonly associated with this type of reasoning.
- [Inductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning) attempts to support a determination of therule. It hypothesizes aruleafter numerous examples are taken to be aconclusionthat follows from apreconditionin terms of such arule. Example: "The grass got wet numerous times when it rained, therefore: the grass always gets wet when it rains." While they may be persuasive, these arguments are not deductively valid, see the [problem of induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_induction).[Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science) is associated with this type of reasoning.
- [Abductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning), a.k.a.inference to the best explanation, selects a [cogent](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cogent) set ofpreconditions. Given a trueconclusionand arule, it attempts to select some possiblepremisesthat, if true also, can support theconclusion, though not uniquely. Example: "When it rains, the grass gets wet. The grass is wet. Therefore, it might have rained." This kind of reasoning can be used to develop a [hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis), which in turn can be tested by additional reasoning or data.[Diagnosticians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostician), [detectives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective), and [scientists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientist) often use this type of reasoning.
