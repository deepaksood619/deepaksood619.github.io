Communication is the key

Communication isn't the key, comprehension is. You can communicate all you want, but if they don't understand you, it won't reach them the way you need it to.

Communication is like salt, a little more or less, both the dish and the project is spoiled.

You should know that when a message you convey to another person is not understood by him, at least one of the following things is true: what you have said is not true, or you have conveyed it without kindness.

Whoever you meet, speak to them like it is the last time you may have that opportunity. It will transform your life -- Sadhguru

Turning action words into identity words (verbs into nouns) is effective because we all strive to uphold positive self-images and avoid labels that make us look bad. One study found that when election campaigns talked about "being a voter," instead of simply asking people to vote, they increased voter turnout by 15%. Another study found that students who heard, "Donâ€™t be a cheater" cheated half as much as students who received the words, "Don't cheat."
