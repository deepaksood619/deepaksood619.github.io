# Buying guides

- **Buy less, choose it well, make it last**
- Don't buy black or white items, it gets very dirty pretty fast
	- Clothes / Shoes
	- Car
- Don't buy a dining table or any table with more surfaces (like an area for storing newspaper below table)
- Don't use dining table cloth
- Don't buy xbox or ps5 buy gaming desktop instead, since it can be used for far more things
- Stock up purchase

- Table - rounded corners and edges, since your wrist gets hurt, and whole hand is laying, so width should be huge with monitor too

### Worst things to buy

1. New Cars: The Depreciating Asset Trap
2. Excessive Home Upgrades: When Bigger Isn’t Better
3. False Economy: The Hidden Cost of Low-Quality Goods
	1. Price is what you pay; value is what you get
	2. buying quality items that last is ultimately more economical than repeatedly replacing cheaper alternatives.
	3. The “cost per use” concept aligns perfectly with Buffett’s approach. A well-made pair of shoes that costs twice as much but lasts four times as long represents a better value proposition than cheaper footwear requiring frequent replacement. This principle applies to everything from kitchen appliances to furniture to tools.
	4. This false economy of cheap goods creates a cycle of replacement purchases that drain resources over time, while quality items often pay dividends through longevity and better performance.
4. Luxury Brand Items: When Status Symbols Become Financial Burdens
5. Lottery Tickets and Gambling: The Statistical Path to Poverty

## International Travel

### SIM

- [Does JIO sim work in US ? : r/india](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/w0nche/does_jio_sim_work_in_us/)
	- No need to buy an international roaming pack if you mainly need the SIM for OTPs. Just turn ON roaming and Wi-Fi calling. Even if there are no signal bars, you’ll still receive OTPs or text messages. Just make sure your SIM has a basic recharge plan active in India to keep it working. I am using it for almost 3 years, no issues for me.

### Others

- IDP is really not required for anyone from India as long as the **driving license is in English.** The IDP is only a translation of your current license and if the information in that is already in English then it’s pointless.
- An International Driving Permit (IDP) isn't a license itself but an official translation and validation of your domestic driving license, allowing you to drive in foreign countries by overcoming language barriers; you must carry both the IDP and your original license, as the IDP only serves as an official supplement, not a replacement, proving you have valid driving privileges abroad. 
- An International Driving Permit (IDP) is typically valid for one year from its issue date.

## Flights

Always take isle seat, so you can get up and move around easily and are not dependent on others, since you don't like sitting for a long time.

Ofcourse it comes with a negative side effect that you have to move in and out if you are asleep and next passenger has to go out.

So for a long haul international flight you can take middle aisle with aisle side seat, so the middle passenger can go out either side and only one passenger has to move out, since there are 2 aisle side seat.
