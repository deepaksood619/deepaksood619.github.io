Focus on being productive instead of being busy. -- Tim Ferriss

Motion does not equal action. Busyness does not equal effectiveness.

Bekaar aadmi kuch kiya kar... Kapde udherkar siya kar...

Process based vs outcome based

OHIO principle, also known as "Only Handle it Once."

The secret to being productive is to work on the right thing - even if it's at a slow pace.

Fight procrastination with mini-deadlines that hold you accountable.

Quickly handle low-priority tasks by keeping your perfectionism at bay.

Time famine - People not having enough time for Doctor, Health, etc

The biggest risk to productivity is always the same: working on the wrong thing.

One thing that you cannot recycle is wasted time

Think about what you want today and you'll spend your time.

Think about what you want in 5 years and you'll invest your time.

Productivity is never an accident. It is always the result of a commitment to excellence, intelligent planning, and focused effort.

Two truths that can be at odds:

1 There are no bonus points in life for doing it the hard way.
2 There is a lot to be gained in life by acting fast and giving your best effort.

Don't let the excuse of searching for a better way prevent you from taking action.

"Sometimes the most productive thing you can do is eliminate the task.

Downsize. The rooms you don't have, don't need to be cleaned.

Donate. The items you don't own, don't need to be organized.

Delete. The projects you don't take on, don't need to be finished.

Is this a problem that needs to be solved? Or is it a problem that can be eliminated all together?"

"It is wonderful how much work can be got through in a day, if we go by the rule - map out our time, divide it off, and take up one thing regularly after another. To drift through our work, or to rush through it in a helter-skelter fashion, ends in comparatively little being done. "One thing at a time" will always perform a better day's work than doing two or three things at a time. By following this rule, one person will do more in a day than another does in a week."

## MIT Technique

A Most Important Task (MIT) is a critical task that will create the most significant results. Every day, create a list of two or three M.I.T.s, and focus on getting them done as soon as possible. Keep this list separate from your general to-do list. -[The PersonalMBA](https://personalmba.com/most-important-tasks/)

## Mental Models

- [Makers vs Manager's Schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)--- "When you're operating on the maker's schedule, meetings are a disaster." (related:[Deep Work](http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/deep-work-the-secret-to-achieving-peak-productivity/))
- [Murphy's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law)--- "Anything that can go wrong, will." (related:[Hofstadter's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law), "It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.")
- [Parkinson's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law)--- "Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion."
- (3) Gate's Law --- "Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years."

### Choosing a productivity system

1. Your system needs to fit your work (not the other way around)
2. The system should counterbalance your worst tendencies.
3. The system needs a way of dealing with exceptions.
4. A good productivity system shouldn't "feel" productive.
5. If your work changes, your system should too.
6. Always measure against your baseline (not somebody else's).
7. A system cannot give your work meaning or motivation.

## Planning

The 10% Rule: Taking Planning Seriously

The first step to becoming a better planner is simply to set aside more time for it. Since we're evolved to be seat-of-our-pants doers, not patient planners, we need to counteract that urge by forcing ourselves to map out the path ahead.

Informally, I like to follow the 10% Rule, which says that you should spend, roughly 10% of the total time you anticipate for a project on planning the project. So if you were going to spend 100 hours on a project, you should spend about 10 hours planning it.

At first this seems crazy large. And, admittedly, this rule can be reduced for longer projects (especially those that might need intermediate planning as you learn more). Yet, for new project types where you lack experience, the time spent planning is often the most valuable.

## 168 Hours By Laura Vanderkam

You Have More Time Than You Think

- You're not too busy -- you're just not in control of your time.
  - Instead of thinking, "I'm too busy," you should ask, "Is that a priority?" If it isn't, simply let it go.
- To live a fulfilling life, focus on your core competencies.
- Choosing a job that uses your core competencies energizes your entire life.
  - "Any 'work' that is not advancing you towards the professional life you want should not count as work. It is wasted time."
- To become time-rich you must control your work calendar.
  - Create habit of excusing yourself from meetings. If you realize a meeting isn't relevant to you, and it's a waste of your time, you should leave. And that time would be better spent pursuing activities that advance your career.
- To achieve a career breakthrough, combine strategy with story.
  - "There's a lot of randomness in the universe, but truly lucky people recognize that fairy godmothers are lazy."
- You can improve your relationships with your children by focusing on your core competencies.
  - If you both love swimming, schedule regular trips to the local pool. A love of music might mean singing together.
- Outsource housework that doesn't align with your core competencies.
- Plan your leisure time to increase its value.
- Actionable advice: Win family time by creating a mini night shift.
  - Working parents often find it difficult to spend time with their children during the week. Overcome this by blocking out 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. in your calendar every weeknight -- and view this as sacred family time. Counter your shorter day at the office by working from 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. a few nights a week. By doing this, you'll maximize your time together while the kids are still awake. Otherwise, you're more likely to waste your evening leisure time in front of the TV.

## Tools

### Liner - a web productivity extension

Liner is a browser extension that lets you highlight anything you see online. Be it articles, images or even videos! The extension saves everything you highlight in a folder so that you can look at it later, all in one place.

“You can also pinpoint time stamps of any YouTube video via it. It’s very handy and convenient and a great tool for research.” she says.
