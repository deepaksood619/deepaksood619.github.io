  - How to develop curiosity in a child (thirst and passion of knowledge)
    - Hard working
    - Balanced life
- Have child early, so that phase is complete and then you can focus on ageing parents (so they both don't coincide)
- Children do not cry if they fall down if no one is around, they will standup and find their parents, and seeing their parents, they will start crying
- Have 3 serial marriages over the lifetime (Youthful passion, Parenthood, Companionship, and all 3 can be the same too) - there are 3 different demands
- **Pre-Marital Genetic Counselling (for rare diseases defect)**
- Minimilism Tricks on Kids - Tell kids that they can have all the toys they want until they can be stored in a cupboard. So they have to make choices, of what they want to buy or what they want to keep. Like they can have all the arts and crafts until they fit in a box.

### Toys

In case you want to set up a business brainwashing affluent parents to spend their money on useless bits of plastic, you will find in this article details of the tricks that firms like Fisher-Price use to flog their products. More constructively, if you are a young parent and you want to buy useful toys for your child, the article says: “After watching kids play with more than 100 different types of toy, the researchers concluded that simple, open-ended, non-realistic toys with multiple parts, like a random assortment of Lego, inspired the highest-quality play. While engaged with such toys, children were “more likely to be creative, engage in problem solving, interact with their peers, and use language,” the researchers wrote. Electronic toys, however, tended to limit kids’ play: “A simple wooden cash register in our study inspired children to engage in lots of conversations related to buying and selling – but a plastic cash register that produced sounds when buttons were pushed mostly inspired children to just push the buttons repeatedly.”

As a result of such research, it is increasingly acknowledged that the best new toys are the best old ones – sticks and blocks and dolls and sand that follow no pre-programmed routines, that elicit no predetermined behaviours.”
