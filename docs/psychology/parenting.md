# Parenting / children

"The children are always ours, every single one of them, all over the globe; and I am beginning to suspect that whoever is incapable of recognizing this may be incapable of morality." -- James Baldwin

- Use adjectives - Teddy’s fur is soft," "The radio is quiet," "The tree outside is big
- Open cup drinking
- **Thoughts**
    - I want to raise my children in UK or US (good child care programs, that develops childs brain) or parents live with me
    - 1st 3 years of the child's brain development is most important
    - Never ever fight before the children
    - How to develop curiosity in a child (thirst and passion of knowledge)
        - Hard working
        - Balanced life
    - Praise for effort and not outcome
- Have child early, so that phase is complete and then you can focus on ageing parents (so they both don't coincide)
- Children do not cry if they fall down if no one is around, they will standup and find their parents, and seeing their parents, they will start crying
- Have 3 serial marriages over the lifetime (Youthful passion, Parenthood, Companionship, and all 3 can be the same too) - there are 3 different demands
- **Pre-Marital Genetic Counselling (for rare diseases defect)**
- Minimilism Tricks on Kids - Tell kids that they can have all the toys they want until they can be stored in a cupboard. So they have to make choices, of what they want to buy or what they want to keep. Like they can have all the arts and crafts until they fit in a box.
- Acknowledge their emotions - tell them that their emotions are valid
- There are no bad children, only bad influences -- Sadhguru

### Questions Every Parent Should Ask

- Do I sometimes solve my child's problems before they even try?
- Do I praise effort as much as I praise achievement?
- Do I allow them to face discomfort, or do I rush to shield them?
- Am I teaching them to listen as much as they speak?

## Questions

- should you let toddlers cry out tantrums

## Aggression - When a Child Hurts Other Children

- **Establish a firm rule:** "Don’t hit. Hitting hurts, and we do not hurt people."
- **For aggressive behavior, give your child a brief time-out in a boring place.** Assign one minute of time-out for every year of the child’s age, to a maximum of five minutes. Time-out helps a child learn to cool down rather than blow up when he is angry. If it looks as if your child might hurt someone, intervene immediately. Stop the behavior at the early threatening or shoving stage. Do not wait until the victim screams or is hurt. If a time-out does not seem to be effective, take away your child’s favorite toy or TV time for the rest of the day.
- **Give special attention to the victim.** After putting your child in time-out, pick up the child who has been injured and give him extra sympathy and attention. It is especially helpful if you can rescue the victim before he is hurt. From the "perpetrator’s" viewpoint, the attention he wanted is now being given to the other child, and that should give him some "food for thought." If fighting among your child and certain playmates or siblings is a pattern, make sure the "victim" isn’t setting up the "perpetrator" in order to gain attention.
- **Suggest acceptable ways to express anger.** Encourage her to come to you when she’s angry and talk about it until she feels better. A second option is to teach your child to stop and count to ten before doing anything about her anger. A third option is to help her learn to walk away from a bad situation. Giving a time-out is one way of helping her walk away from anger.
- **Verbalize your child’s feelings for him.** If he can’t talk about his anger, put it into words for him: "I know that you feel angry." It is unrealistic to expect your child not to feel anger. You may need to make an understanding statement such as, "You wish you could punch your brother, but we cannot hurt other people."
- **Teach your child acceptable ways to get what she wants.** Teach her how to ask or negotiate for what she wants rather than talking about it. Teach her how to take turns and how to trade one of her toys for the use of another child’s toy.
- **Never hit your child for hitting someone else.** Hitting your child only teaches him that it is fine to hit if you are bigger. If your child tends to be aggressive, it is critical to eliminate all physical punishment, such as spanking. You can use many other consequences to help teach your child right from wrong
- **Praise your child for friendly behavior**
- **Take preventive measures.** Set a good example for your child. Demonstrate self-control and verbal problem solving. Help your child avoid playmates who tease persistently and situations in which he often gets into fights. When your child becomes tired or hungry, leave the play setting until these needs are met.

### Tantrum

Despite the term "the terrible twos," temper tantrums can start as early as 12 months and continue beyond age 3 or 4 — though they do occur most commonly during a child’s second or third year.

#### Why tantrums happen

- Frustrated with his own limited abilities to express his feelings and communicate with words
- Hungry, tired, overstimulated or bored
- The need to assert independence
- A lack of control

#### Preventing toddler temper tantrums

While sometimes tantrums are inevitable, a few smart strategies can help head them off:

- **Work with your child's personality.** For many kids, keeping a schedule of regular mealtimes, [nap times](https://www.whattoexpect.com/toddler-naps.aspx) and bedtimes offers a sense of what they can expect at various points in their day — which makes them feel more secure, in control and comforted. However, other kids thrive on spontaneity — so if your child seems to get stressed out by schedules, ease up a bit.
- **Ward off the "fearsome four."** Hunger, fatigue, boredom and overstimulation, that is. That means avoid overscheduling or planning a big excursion (like grocery shopping) before nap time. And make sure to leave the house when your toddler's tummy is full — and with healthy snacks and a favorite small toy or book in tow.
- **Cut down on the need to say "no."** This includes [childproofing your home](https://www.whattoexpect.com/nursery-decorating/childproofing-basics.aspx) (so you don't have to constantly cry, "No, don't touch that!") and setting clear limits.
- **Provide choice whenever possible (but not too many).** Being able to make simple decisions ("Do you want to eat cereal or yogurt this morning?") helps a toddler feel more in control.
- **Don't say "maybe."** In toddler translation, "maybe" equals "yes." Instead, say "yes" or "no," or negotiate a compromise.

#### 9 ways to cope with a toddler temper tantrum

1. Play a game
2. Make your child laugh
3. Hide
4. Seek
5. Allow the forbidden
6. Speak softly
7. Don't react
8. Stand your ground
9. Hold him

#### Temper tantrum don'ts

- **Whatever you do, don't give in to his demands.** This only teaches the lesson that tantrums are a means to an end. If you're out in public and your child won't calm down, consider ending the outing.
- **Don't minimize his feelings.** Avoid saying things like, "It's not a big deal" or, "There's nothing to get so upset about."
- **Don't use physical punishment.** It's never a good idea, but it's especially risky at a time when emotions are running high and you're in danger of losing control.

### Six-Pocket Syndrome

The term emerged in China during its one-child policy era. With shrinking family sizes, every child effectively had six adults two parents and four grandparents, focusing their emotional and financial resources on them. Six pockets, all pouring into one tiny life.

It sounds ideal, a cocoon of love and opportunity. But psychologists soon noticed side effects: a generation of "little emperors" used to getting their way, struggling with sharing, criticism, or failure.

Over time, "Six-Pocket Syndrome" has become shorthand for overindulgence - when a child grows up surrounded by affection and abundance, but with few boundaries or responsibilities.

#### INDIA'S OWN VERSION OF THE SYNDROME

- India may not have a one-child policy, but rising affluence, smaller families, and aspirational parenting have created similar conditions. Urban households, especially, pour tremendous energy into one child's academic, emotional, and extracurricular success.
- Parents enroll them in coding classes at five, buy the latest gadgets to "keep them ahead," and often protect them from any form of discomfort. Add doting grandparents and domestic help to the mix - and you have your own six pockets of unconditional support.
- But unconditional support can easily slide into uncritical indulgence. When every wish is met and every mistake excused, children begin to internalize a skewed sense of self - one where they are always right, always special, always in control.

#### THE EDUCATION-PARENTING PARADOX

Modern parenting is a complex juggling act. We want our children to be confident, not submissive; expressive, not meek. But the pendulum has swung too far toward validation without restraint.

- Education experts suggest that the goal should not be to crush confidence but to contextualize it.
- Teach children that confidence isn't about always being right - it's about being willing to learn.
- Show them that humility is not weakness, but wisdom.
- Encourage them to speak up, but also to listen deeply.

Schools, too, must evolve. Academic brilliance alone is no longer a marker of readiness for the world. Emotional intelligence, resilience, and empathy must sit at the heart of pedagogy.

### Precocity

Precocity is the **state of having developed certain abilities or behaviors at a much younger age than is typical**. It refers to exceptionally early mental, and sometimes physical, development, such as a child's advanced intellect or a puppy's advanced training. The word comes from the Latin praecox, meaning "early ripening".

- **Mental Development:** This is the most common context for precocity, referring to a child who has an advanced intellect or a unique way of thinking. For example, a child who can discuss complex topics far beyond their age group is displaying mental precocity.
- **Physical Development:** While less common in general discussion, the term can also refer to physical maturity that occurs early.
- **Behavior:** It can also describe unusual behaviors that seem ahead of a person's years. For example, a very young child who acts with the maturity and independence of an older child might be called precocious.
- **Etymology:** The word has a clear etymological root in the Latin praecoquere, which means "to bake or ripen early," further emphasizing the idea of early maturity.

## Parenting

Why kicking out children after 18 years is important, let's say you are very wealthy and have a good house and all house help, why would children move out and work since everything is set in their home. They will just stay and spend lavishly, they will not know the pain and effort it takes to create that wealth and blunder it away.

### Parenting Styles

- **Authoritarian parenting** is a strict, control-oriented style marked by high demands and low responsiveness. Parents enforce rigid rules, expect unquestioning obedience, and often use punishment rather than dialogue to correct behavior. Emotional warmth and open communication are minimal, with the focus placed on discipline and conformity. While this approach may produce obedience in the short term, it often stifles independence, lowers self-esteem, and can lead to anxiety or rebellion in children. The emphasis on authority over understanding leaves little room for nurturing emotional intelligence or autonomy.
- **Authoritative parenting** strikes a balanced approach by combining high expectations with warmth, responsiveness, and clear communication. Parents set firm boundaries and enforce rules consistently but also encourage independence, reasoning, and dialogue. This style fosters self-discipline, emotional intelligence, and social competence in children, as they feel both supported and accountable. Unlike authoritarian parenting, it emphasizes mutual respect over obedience, promoting internal motivation rather than fear-based compliance.
- **Permissive parenting** is characterized by warmth and affection but lacks consistent discipline, structure, and clear boundaries. Parents in this style tend to be indulgent, often avoiding confrontation and allowing children considerable freedom to regulate their own behavior. While emotionally nurturing, permissive parenting may lead to children struggling with self-control, authority, and responsibility, as they grow up with minimal expectations or accountability. This approach often prioritizes the child’s immediate happiness over long-term development of resilience and discipline.
- **Neglectful parenting**, also known as uninvolved parenting, is marked by a lack of responsiveness, warmth, and structure. These parents are often emotionally distant, minimally engaged, and provide little guidance, supervision, or support. Basic physical needs may be met, but emotional and psychological needs are frequently ignored. As a result, children raised in neglectful environments may struggle with low self-esteem, poor academic performance, attachment issues, and difficulty forming healthy relationships. This parenting style can severely impair a child’s emotional and social development due to the absence of both nurturing and discipline.
- **Helicopter parenting** is a hyper-involved style where parents closely monitor and manage nearly every aspect of their child's life, often out of anxiety or a desire to ensure success. While well-intentioned, this overprotection can hinder a child’s ability to develop independence, problem-solving skills, and resilience. Constant interference—whether in academics, social life, or daily decisions—can create dependence, reduce self-confidence, and increase stress in children. By shielding them from failure or discomfort, helicopter parents may unintentionally delay emotional and cognitive growth.

## Speech Delay

### Solutions

- Reading with kids
- Give child time to respond
- No screen time
- Playing with kid

### Medical Reasons

- Leucovorin, also known as calcium folinate and leucovorin calcium, is **a type of vitamin B9, or folate**. Folate, which is naturally found in certain foods, helps the body make healthy red blood cells and is important for overall brain function.
- A Folate Receptor Antibody Test (FRAT®) is a blood test that detects autoantibodies to folate receptor alpha (FRα), a protein vital for transporting folate (vitamin B9) into the brain. The presence of these autoantibodies suggests impaired folate transport, leading to cerebral folate deficiency (CFD), and can be associated with neurodevelopmental disorders like autism, unexplained neurological symptoms, or certain neuropsychiatric conditions. Treatment may involve alternative folate forms, such as folinic acid, to bypass the blocked receptors.
- Infants and children with symptoms of cerebral folate deficiency or developmental delays.
- **cerebral folate deficiency (CFD)**, a lack of folate in the brain, can cause a child to be nonverbal. CFD can be caused by genetic mutations or autoimmune factors like folate receptor antibodies that block folate from entering the brain. Folate is crucial for brain development and neurotransmitter function, and a lack of it leads to developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and speech difficulties, including being nonverbal. Treatment with the active form of folate, such as folinic acid, can improve communication in children with CFD.

- [12 Tricks to Get Your Toddler to Take Medicine](https://www.whattoexpect.com/toddler-health/get-toddler-to-take-medicine.aspx)
- Laying a child down and forcing them to take medicine while crying is extremely dangerous due to the high risk of choking. A crying, struggling toddler can easily inhale liquid medicine into their lungs, which can be life-threatening. Medical professionals strongly advise against this method.
- **The proper technique**
	- **Keep the child upright:** Always have the child in a seated or upright position, such as on your lap.
	- **Use a syringe:** Use a plastic oral syringe to control the flow and amount of liquid.
	- **Aim for the cheek:** Slowly squirt the medicine into the side of the mouth, aiming for the cheek pouch between the gums and cheek. This bypasses the taste buds and allows them to swallow more easily.
	- **Hold the mouth closed:** Gently hold the child's mouth closed and stroke under their chin to encourage them to swallow.
- **Strategies for a resistant toddler**
	- **Offer small choices:** Give the child a sense of control by letting them choose the syringe, which cup to use, or what fun reward they will get afterward.
	- **Mask the flavor:** Ask your pharmacist if it's safe to mix the medicine into a small amount of a favorite food, like applesauce, yogurt, or chocolate syrup. Do not mix it into an entire bottle or large dish, as the child must eat the whole portion to get the full dose.
	- **Numb the taste buds:** Let the child suck on a popsicle or ice cube beforehand to temporarily numb their taste buds.
	- **Make it a game:** Distract the child by making funny faces or singing songs. Some parents have success playing pretend, letting the child give "medicine" to a stuffed animal first.
	- **Have two adults help:** If the child is truly struggling, have one adult hold the child calmly in their lap while the other administers the medicine.
	- **Stay calm and positive:** Your child can sense your frustration. Staying calm and cheerful can make the process less stressful for everyone.
	- **Reward good behavior:** After they take the medicine, praise them and offer a non-food reward like a sticker or a hug.

- suppository
	- A suppository is a solid medication inserted into a body cavity (such as the rectum or vagina) where it dissolves to release medication for local or systemic effects. They are used to treat conditions like constipation, hemorrhoids, and fever, or to deliver medicine when a person cannot swallow or absorb oral medications. The medication is designed to be absorbed into the bloodstream through the mucous membranes in the rectal or vaginal wall.
