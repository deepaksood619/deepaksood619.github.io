## Akrasia

Akrasiais the state of acting against your better judgment. It is when you do one thing even though you know you should do something else. Loosely translated, you could say thatakrasiais procrastination or a lack of self-control.Akrasiais what prevents you from following through on what you set out to do.

One explanation for whyakrasiarules our lives and procrastination pulls us in has to do with a behavioral economics term called "time inconsistency." Time inconsistency refers to the tendency of the human brain to value immediate rewards more highly than future rewards.
