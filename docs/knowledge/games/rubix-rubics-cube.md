State 1

If no corner Cubes are yellow on the top face, you must have yellow left corner or left face as shown.

State 2

If one corner Cube is yellow match your top face as shown and do the sequence below.

State 3

If any two corner Cubes are yellow don't worry about their position. You MUST match the front face with a yellow left corner as shown Do this sequence 1, 2 or 3 times to achieve a complete yellow top face. After each sequence, orient the Rubik's Cube to REMATCH the top face to the appropriate state and repeat the sequence until all the corners are yellow

**Final Layer**

1st Step: Position yellow corners correctly

While holding your Rubik's Cube as shown above, look at the top face. Place the 2 correct corners in the back A, B or diagonally A, D or B, C across from each other.

If you need to switch diagonal corners like B and C or D and A, then do the sequence once. Then, orient the Cube so the 2 correct corners are in the back and do the sequence again.

2nd Step: Position yellow edges correctly

If 1 edge is correct and 3 edges are incorrect orient the Rubik's Cube so the face with the correct edge is the back face. Then determine if the edge pieces need to move clockwise or counter-clockwise and do the correct sequence below.

If all 4 edges are incorrect, then do either sequence below once, and then determine what direction the three edge pieces need to move and do the correct sequence below.
