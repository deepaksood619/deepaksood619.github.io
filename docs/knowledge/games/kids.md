In case you want to set up a business brainwashing affluent parents to spend their money on useless bits of plastic, you will find in this article details of the tricks that firms like Fisher-Price use to flog their products. More constructively, if you are a young parent and you want to buy useful toys for your child, the article says: "After watching kids play with more than 100 different types of toy, the researchers concluded that simple, open-ended, non-realistic toys with multiple parts, like a random assortment of Lego, inspired the highest-quality play. While engaged with such toys, children were "more likely to be creative, engage in problem solving, interact with their peers, and use language," the researchers wrote. Electronic toys, however, tended to limit kids’ play: "A simple wooden cash register in our study inspired children to engage in lots of conversations related to buying and selling - but a plastic cash register that produced sounds when buttons were pushed mostly inspired children to just push the buttons repeatedly."

As a result of such research, it is increasingly acknowledged that the best new toys are the best old ones - sticks and blocks and dolls and sand that follow no pre-programmed routines, that elicit no predetermined behaviours."

During an episode of his show “Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee” with fellow comedian Kevin Hart, Jerry Seinfeld revealed his approach to handling questions from his children about his wealth. When his kids ask, “Are we rich?” Seinfeld’s response is characteristically direct: **"I am. You’re not."**

Warren Buffett’s daughter wanted to redo her kitchen and asked for a loan from him. Buffett’s response was simple and direct: **"Why not go to the bank?"** rather than providing the funds himself.
