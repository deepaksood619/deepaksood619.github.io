# Chess

**King - Priceless, Queen - 9, Rook - 5, Bishop (better than knight) - 3, Knight - 3, Pawn - 1**

### Algebraic Notation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)

- K for [king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_(chess))
- Q for [queen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(chess))
- R for [rook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rook_(chess))
- B for [bishop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_(chess))
- N for [knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_(chess))(since K is already used).

### Files

- Closed file - Contains 1 or more white pawns, AND 1 or more black pawns
- Opened file - No pawns
- Half-opened file for white - Contains no white pawns, AND 1 or more black pawns
- Half-opened file for black - Contains no black pawns, AND 1 more white pawns
- Pawn Break - A pawn advance or capture that opens a position

### Moves

Each move of a piece is indicated by the piece's uppercase letter, plus the coordinate of the destination square. For example, **Be5** (move a bishop to e5), **Nf3** (move a knight to f3). For pawn moves, a letter indicating pawn is not used, only the destination square is given. For example, **c5** (move a pawn to c5).

**Is it possible to checkmate with only a knight and a king against a lone king?**

- If you drive an enemy king into a corner, you still need to control four different squares to checkmate him. Your king can control two of those squares (but cannot approach the enemy king), your knight can control the third, but there is no way of controlling the fourth. That is, it is impossible for the knight to control both the corner square and the one adjacent to the enemy king (the one your own king doesn't control).
- So the result would be a draw -- insufficient material to win.
- Not only this, but N+N+K vs. K can't even win! This is one of the great tragedies of chess
- Checkmate with either 1 bishop or 1 knight and a king against a lone king is IMPOSSIBLE.

### Principle

- Never move a chess piece twice before 1st 10 moves
- Try to control as much of the center as possible (Control the center)
- Do castle in first 7 moves

## Tactics and Strategy

Tactics - Play characterized by short-term attacks and threats

- Developing / Productive Moves
- Non-developing / Un-productive moves
- Reacting moves
- Tempi / Moves / Time

### Opening

- Pawn duo
- Don't block your central pawns

### Others

- Double attack
- **Fork** (royal fork - when both king and queen are attacked)
- **Pin**
    - Absolute pin (pin on king)
    - Relative pin
- **Skewer**
    - When you attack a valuable piece, compel it to move to avoid capture, which then exposes a less valuable piece for capture
    - You may be vulnerable to a pin or skewer tactic if you have multiple pieces on the same file, rank or diagonal
- **Deflection**
    - When you chase away a piece from an important square
    - You may be vulnerable to a deflection tactic if one of your pieces has a defensive responsibility
- **Discovered check** or discovered attack
- **Double check** - when two pieces attack the king simultaneously, a double check by it's nature involves a discovered check.. In most cases king has to move
- **Clearance** - When you move one of your pieces out of the way of another. This will allow one of your pieces to then make use of a certain square, file, rank or diagonal
- **Interference** - When you disrupt the coordination between enemy pieces
- Staying coordinated (Having your pieces defending one another) makes it more difficult for your opponent to use a tactic to win material
- **Windmill** - A combination where two pieces work together to deliver an alternating series of checks and discovered checks
- Tactics are the servant of strategy

## Chess Pawn Basics

- Passed Pawn (Passer) - A pawn that no enemy pawn can stop on its way to queening
- Protected Passed Pawn
- Isolated Pawn - a pawn with no pawn of the same color on the files next to it
- Doubled Pawns - two pawns of the same color that are on the same file
- Hanging Pawns - two pawns of the same color that are together and don't have any pawns of the same color on the files next to them
- Backward Pawn - a pawn that trails behind a pawn of the same color on an adjacent file
- Candidate Passed Pawn - the pawn of a pawn majority that can produce a passed pawn and that is on a half-opened file. Candidate passed pawns should lead the way.
- Fixed Pawn - a pawn that cannot move (capture) due to an enemy pawn blocking it
- Pawn Island - a group of pawns of one color on consecutive files with no other pawns of the same color on any adjacent files. In general, the fewer pawn islands you have the better.
- Pawn Chain - a fixed and connected diagonal formation of pawns

#### Smothered mate

- The centre (e4, d4, e5, d5)
- Sacrifice
- Blunder
- Hope chess

#### Others

- Hope Chess - Make a threatening move towards your opponent even though you know it's bad, and hope they won't respond well

## Fast Chess

**Fast chess** is a type of chess in which each player is given less time to consider their moves than normal tournament [time controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_control) allow. Fast chess is further subdivided, by decreasing time controls, into [rapid chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_chess#Rapid), [blitz chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_chess#Blitz), and [bullet chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_chess#Bullet).[Armageddon chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_chess#Armageddon) is a particular variation in which different rules apply for each of the two players.

## ELO Rating System

The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in[zero-sum games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game)such as [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess). It is named after its creator [Arpad Elo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arpad_Elo), a Hungarian-American physics professor.

The Elo system was originally invented as an improved chess-rating system over the previously used [Harkness system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harkness_rating_system), but is also used as a rating system for multiplayer competition in a number of [video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game), [association football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football), [American football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football),[basketball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball), [Major League Baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball), [table tennis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis), [board games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_game) such as [Scrabble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble) and [Diplomacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_(game)), and other games.

The difference in the ratings between two players serves as a predictor of the outcome of a match. Two players with equal ratings who play against each other are expected to score an equal number of wins. A player whose rating is 100 points greater than their opponent's is expected to score 64%; if the difference is 200 points, then the expected score for the stronger player is 76%.

A player's Elo rating is represented by a number which may change depending on the outcome of rated games played. After every game, the winning player takes points from the losing one. The difference between the ratings of the winner and loser determines the total number of points gained or lost after a game. If the high-rated player wins, then only a few rating points will be taken from the low-rated player. However, if the lower-rated player scores an [upset win](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upset_(competition)), many rating points will be transferred. The lower-rated player will also gain a few points from the higher rated player in the event of a draw. This means that this rating system is self-correcting. Players whose ratings are too low or too high should, in the long run, do better or worse correspondingly than the rating system predicts and thus gain or lose rating points until the ratings reflect their true playing strength.

An Elo rating is a comparative rating only, and is valid only within the rating pool where it was established.
