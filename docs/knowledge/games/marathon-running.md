## VO~2~ max

**VO~2~max** (also **maximal oxygen consumption**, **maximal oxygen uptake**, **peak oxygen uptake** or **maximal aerobic capacity**) is the maximum rate of oxygen consumption measured during[incremental exercise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_exercise); that is, exercise of increasing intensity.The name is derived from three abbreviations: "V" for[volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume), "O~2~" for[oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen), and "max" for maximum. Maximal oxygen consumption reflects[cardiorespiratory fitness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiorespiratory_fitness)and[endurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance)capacity in exercise performance.

VO2 max is measured in milliliters of oxygen used in one minute per kilogram of body weight (mL/kg/min). It is based on the premise that the more oxygen an athlete consumes during high-level exercise, the more the body will generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) energy in cells. ATP is often referred to as the "molecular unit of currency" of intracellular energy,

VO2 max should not be confused with the[lactate threshold (LT)](https://www.verywellfit.com/lactate-threshold-training-3120092)testing, which refers to the point during high-intensity exercise where[lactate](https://www.verywellfit.com/lactic-acid-and-performance-3119185)builds up in the muscles faster than it can be removed.

### Techniques

1. Head - Don't look at your feet - Be sure to gaze directly infront of you
2. Shoulders - You should pull them back, almost like you're squeezing a pencil between your shoulder blades
3. Arms - Your arms should be at a 90-degree angle,
4. Hands - Relaxed, open not closed
5. Torso - You always want to keep a tight core while running - it'll prevent you from going too far forward or too far backwards," says Fierras. But that doesn't mean your core shouldn't move or react at all. "When you take a left step forward, I actually want to see a torque shift over toward the left side so you have most of the weight over that left leg and so that power gets generated through and stays through the torso
6. Hips - When you're running, you want lean slightlyintothe run versus running completely upright. "That lean should come from the hinge at your hips, not from rolling your shoulders forward," says Fierras. That means your torso will be slightly forward of your hips. "If not, you can't use your hip base or your gluteus maximus to derive the most power you can get out of your stride
7. Knees - Your knee should be in line with the middle of your foot so that when your foot strikes the ground, it's right under your knee. "You don't want to lift your knee up to a 90-degree angle if you're on a flat road; you want to keep it down low so you're not wasting that energy on the knee drive," says Fierras.

    Lots of runners, especially when they're fatigued, struggle with the runner shuffle, where they're barely picking their feet up off the ground. If that's the case, you can try lifting your knees a little higher so you have a little more time in the air for your foot to get in the right position. "And you really want to focus of keeping that knee directly in front of your hips versus turning in or bowing out, which is very hard for people to train themselves to do," she says.

8. Legs - the easiest way to think about your lower body is to think about your shin being as close to perpendicular as possible when the foot hits the ground," Mahon says. If a person is a heavy heel striker, their angle is too big; if they're a forefoot striker, their angle is too small. Either way, it's a negative position to be in because you're opening yourself up to injuries in the other foot or knee. "You also won't be using all the joints you have properly in the right timing sequence," he says. "If you land at that 90-degree angle, then you get to use your ankle, your knee joint, and the hip joint all at the same time to both absorb shock and then create energy.
9. Foot - the idea is to aim to hit the road with the ball of your foot, That's going to help you propel forward better, and your stride won't come out too far in front of you.
