# HVAC Systems

- H - Heating
- V - Ventilation
- AC - Air Conditioning

### Metrics

Commercial buildings account for 40% of the global energy consumption. 60-70% of this consumption goes towards the Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems of the building. Inefficient operations can easily account for 20-30% of the total energy waste. Eliminating such a waste can help reduce global energy consumption by 10%. This is beneficial not only for businesses in terms of cost effectiveness, but also benefits the environment by lowering greenhouse gas emissions. It’s also our responsibility to plug such leakages in our attempt to pass on a planet that is better than the one we inherited from our previous generations.

If we further break down the HVAC system by the energy consumed by its individual components, we can see that in a typical setting:

- 34% of the HVAC’s energy is used by the fans for air circulation and ventilation.
- 27% of the energy is used by chillers to produce chilled water for cooling.
- 17% is used by boilers to produce hot water for heating.
- 16% is used by pumps for the circulation of hot water, chilled water and condenser water.
- 6% is used by cooling towers for heat rejection.
