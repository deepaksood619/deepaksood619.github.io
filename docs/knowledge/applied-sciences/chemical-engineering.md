# Chemical Engineering

## Chemical Engineering

- Chemical engineering is one of the broadest of the engineering fields, focused not only on chemicals - which make up everything - but also on developing and designing plants and processes for manufacturing chemicals
- Blanc process: to create sodium ash from sodium chloride
- Cracking
- Polymerization
- It's important to think of processes as a whole, but it will be just as important to break down our chemical plant into unit operations when we get to the manufacturing phase
- Biomass: renewable orgainic material that comes from plants and animals. This range from wood and leftover crops, to garbage and manure
