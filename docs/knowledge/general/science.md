# Science

Science is not a collection of facts about the world. That is called **knowledge**.

Rather, science is a **process - a way of thinking** and making sense of the world, which can then lead to new knowledge.

Science(from [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language) scientia, meaning "knowledge") is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge) in the form of testable [explanations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explanation) and [predictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictions) about the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe).

The earliest roots of science can be traced to [Ancient Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt) and [Mesopotamia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia) in around 3500 to 3000 BCE.Their contributions to [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy), and [medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine) entered and shaped [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece)[natural philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_philosophy) of [classical antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity), whereby formal attempts were made to explain events of the [physical world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe) based on natural causes.After the [fall of the Western Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire), knowledge of [Greek conceptions of the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science_in_classical_antiquity) deteriorated in [Western Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe) during the early centuries (400 to 1000 CE) of the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages) but was preserved in the [Muslim world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world) during the [Islamic Golden Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age).The recovery and assimilation of [Greek works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_literature) and [Islamic inquiries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_in_the_medieval_Islamic_world) into Western Europe from the 10th to 13th century revived natural philosophy, which was later transformed by the [Scientific Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Revolution) that began in the 16th centuryas [new ideas and discoveries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Revolution#New_ideas) departed from [previous Greek conceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Revolution#Ancient_and_medieval_background) and traditions.The [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and it was not until the [19th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19th_century_in_science) that many of the institutional and [professional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientist) features of science began to take shape.

The branches of science, also referred to as [sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science), "scientific fields", or "scientific disciplines," are commonly divided into three major groups:

- [Formal sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_science): the study of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) and [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic), which use an [a priori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori), as opposed to [factual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact), [methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology).
- [Natural sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_science): the study of natural phenomena (including cosmological, geological, chemical, and biological factors of the universe)
- [Social sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science): the study of [human behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_behavior) and [societies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society).
