### Tryst with Destiny

Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom.

### Modi ni to who

Modi ni to who - no one, it will be modi only, modi is a great person. Just itna bda desh chalana akele mushkil h, unke aas pass ke log sahi kaam ni kr rhe h, so unki help karni hogi humko.

Just thoda bhatak gye h, unko sahi rah me lana h.

Unko nazar lag gyi h, itna acha kaam krte the. Thoda unka is time me humko support krna hoga.
