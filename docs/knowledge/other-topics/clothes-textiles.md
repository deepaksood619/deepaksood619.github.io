### Pill

A pill, colloquially known as a **bobble, fuzzball, orlint ball** is a small ball of fibers that forms on a piece of [cloth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloth). Pillis also a verb for the formation of such balls.

Pilling is a surface defect of textiles caused by wear, and is generally considered an undesirable trait.It happens when washing and wearing of fabrics causes loose fibers to begin to push out from the surface of the cloth, and, over time, abrasion causes the fibers to develop into small spherical bundles, anchored to the surface of the fabric by protruding fibers that haven't broken. The textile industry divides pilling into four stages: **fuzz formation, entanglement, growth, and wear-off.**

Pilling normally happens on the parts of clothing that receive the most abrasion in day-to-day wear, such as the [collar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collar_(clothing)), [cuffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuff), and around the [thighs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thighs) and [rear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttocks) on [trousers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trousers).

### Knit vs Woven Fabric

#### Construction

Woven fabrics are created on weaving looms. These looms can be 54 inches wide and above. The main difference between knit vs woven fabrics is how they are constructed. Woven fabrics are created using several warps, or longitudinal yarns, and wefts, or latitudinal yarns. Knitting involves interloping or interlacing a single yarn or thread.

#### Twill

**Twill** is a type of [textile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile "Textile") [weave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaving "Weaving") with a pattern of diagonal parallel ribs. It is one of three fundamental types of [textile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile "Textile") [weaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaving "Weaving") along with [plain weave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_weave "Plain weave") and [satin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satin "Satin"). It is made by passing the [weft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weft "Weft") thread over one or more [warp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warp_(weaving) "Warp (weaving)") threads then under two or more warp threads and so on, with a "step," or offset, between rows to create the characteristic diagonal pattern. Because of this structure, twill generally drapes well.

Twills can be divided into _even-sided_, _warp-faced_, and _weft-faced_. Even sided twills have the same amount of warp and weft threads visible on both sides of the fabric. Warp-faced twills have more warp threads visible on the face side, and weft-faced twills have more weft threads visible on the face side. Even-sided twills include [foulard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foulard "Foulard") or surah, [herringbone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herringbone_(cloth) "Herringbone (cloth)"), [houndstooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houndstooth "Houndstooth"), [serge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serge_(fabric) "Serge (fabric)"), [sharkskin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharkskin "Sharkskin"), and twill [flannel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flannel "Flannel"). Warp-faced twills include cavalry twill, [chino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chino_cloth "Chino cloth"), covert, [denim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denim "Denim"), [drill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drill_(fabric) "Drill (fabric)"), fancy twill, [gabardine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabardine "Gabardine"), and lining twill.
