## Mental Models

- [Consequentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism) - "Holding that the consequences of one's conduct are the ultimate basis for any judgment about the rightness or wrongness of that conduct." (related: "ends justify the means")
- [Distributive Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributive_justice) vs [Procedural Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_justice) - "Procedural justice concerns the fairness and the transparency of the processes by which decisions are made, and may be contrasted with distributive justice (fairness in the distribution of rights or resources), and retributive justice (fairness in the punishment of wrongs)."
- **[Utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism)-** "Holding that the best moral action is the one that maximizes utility."

The doctrine that an action is right in so far as it promotes happiness, and that the greatest happiness of the greatest number should be the guiding principle of conduct.

- [Agnosticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnosticism) - "The view that the truth values of certain claims - especially metaphysical and religious claims such as whether God, the divine, or the supernatural exist - are unknown and perhaps unknowable."
- [Veil of Ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance) - "A method of determining the morality of a certain issue (e.g., slavery) based upon the following thought experiment: parties to the original position know nothing about the particular abilities, tastes, and positions individuals will have within a social order. When such parties are selecting the principles for distribution of rights, positions, and resources in the society in which they will live, the veil of ignorance prevents them from knowing who will receive a given distribution of rights, positions, and resources in that society."

## Effective Altruism

Encourages individuals to consider all causes and actions, and then act in the way that brings about the greatest positive impact, based on their values.

MacAskill finds a paper from 1972 titled ‘Famine, Affluence, and Morality’. It’s written by an Australian ethical philosopher Peter Singer and has a simple premise-"If you have money, you have an obligation to donate and help those who are less fortunate."

Effective Altruism (EA) with a relatively simple goal-put money to the best use possible! He asks people to be more generous with their wealth. But unlike traditional charities, he wants their generosity to be effective. He wants them to adopt a rational and mathematical approach while resolving moral quandaries.

And the idea stuck.

At its core, EA looked at 3 key things.

1. How much good can you achieve by working on a problem
2. How solvable is the problem
3. How neglected is the cause

The key problem is funding cannibalism. That $3 million in donations doesn’t appear out of a vacuum. Because people on average are limited in how much they’re willing to donate to good causes, if someone donates $100 to the ALS Association, he or she will likely donate less to other charities."
