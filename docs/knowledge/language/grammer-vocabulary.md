# Grammer / Vocabulary

In [linguistics]$1 $2) is the set of [structural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural) rules governing the composition of [clauses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clause_(linguistics)), [phrases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase) and [words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words) in a [natural language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language). The term refers also to the study of such rules and this field includes [phonology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonology), [morphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(linguistics)) and [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax), often complemented by [phonetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetics), [semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics) and [pragmatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatics).

Fluent speakers of a [language variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(linguistics)) orlecthave a set of internalized rules for using that form of speech. This rule set constitutes the lect's grammar. The vast majority of the information in the grammar is -- at least in the case of one's [native language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_language)--[acquired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_acquisition) not by conscious study or [instruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_teaching) but by hearing other speakers. Much of this work is done during early childhood; learning a language later in life usually involves a greater degree of explicit instruction. Thus, grammar is the cognitive information underlying language use.

The word [grammar](https://www.thoughtco.com/word-grammar-1692610) comes from Greek, meaning "**craft of letters**," which is an apt description. In any language, grammar is:

1. the systematic study and description of a [language](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-a-language-1691218). (Compare with [usage](https://www.thoughtco.com/usage-grammar-1692575).)

2. a set of [rules](https://www.thoughtco.com/rules-of-english-1691922) and examples dealing with the [syntax](https://www.thoughtco.com/syntax-grammar-1692182) and [word](https://www.thoughtco.com/word-english-language-1692612) structures ([morphology](https://www.thoughtco.com/morphology-words-term-1691407)) of a language.

## Types of grammer

Whereas students of English mainly have to deal with just the nuts-and-bolts [prescriptive](https://www.thoughtco.com/prescriptive-grammar-1691668), [traditional](https://www.thoughtco.com/traditional-grammar-1692556) type of grammar, such as making sure verbs and subjects agree and where to put commas, linguists have many more types to examine different aspects of the language, from how different languages compare to each other ([comparative grammar](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-comparative-grammar-1689884)) or use grammatical parts ([descriptive](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-descriptive-grammar-1690439) grammar) to how the words and their usage interact to create meaning ([lexicogrammar](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-a-lexicogrammar-1691120)). They study how people acquire language and debate whether every child is born with a concept of [universal grammar](https://www.thoughtco.com/universal-grammar-1692571). Teachers instructing English language learners follow a method of [pedagogical grammar](https://www.thoughtco.com/pedagogical-grammar-1691600) for their students.
