# Grammer / Vocabulary

In [linguistics]$1 $2) is the set of [structural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural) rules governing the composition of [clauses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clause_(linguistics)), [phrases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase) and [words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words) in a [natural language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language). The term refers also to the study of such rules and this field includes [phonology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonology), [morphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(linguistics)) and [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax), often complemented by [phonetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetics), [semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics) and [pragmatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatics).

Fluent speakers of a [language variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(linguistics)) orlecthave a set of internalized rules for using that form of speech. This rule set constitutes the lect's grammar. The vast majority of the information in the grammar is -- at least in the case of one's [native language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_language)--[acquired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_acquisition) not by conscious study or [instruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_teaching) but by hearing other speakers. Much of this work is done during early childhood; learning a language later in life usually involves a greater degree of explicit instruction. Thus, grammar is the cognitive information underlying language use.

The word [grammar](https://www.thoughtco.com/word-grammar-1692610) comes from Greek, meaning "**craft of letters**," which is an apt description. In any language, grammar is:

1. the systematic study and description of a [language](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-a-language-1691218). (Compare with [usage](https://www.thoughtco.com/usage-grammar-1692575).)

2. a set of [rules](https://www.thoughtco.com/rules-of-english-1691922) and examples dealing with the [syntax](https://www.thoughtco.com/syntax-grammar-1692182) and [word](https://www.thoughtco.com/word-english-language-1692612) structures ([morphology](https://www.thoughtco.com/morphology-words-term-1691407)) of a language.

## Types of grammer

Whereas students of English mainly have to deal with just the nuts-and-bolts [prescriptive](https://www.thoughtco.com/prescriptive-grammar-1691668), [traditional](https://www.thoughtco.com/traditional-grammar-1692556) type of grammar, such as making sure verbs and subjects agree and where to put commas, linguists have many more types to examine different aspects of the language, from how different languages compare to each other ([comparative grammar](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-comparative-grammar-1689884)) or use grammatical parts ([descriptive](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-descriptive-grammar-1690439) grammar) to how the words and their usage interact to create meaning ([lexicogrammar](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-a-lexicogrammar-1691120)). They study how people acquire language and debate whether every child is born with a concept of [universal grammar](https://www.thoughtco.com/universal-grammar-1692571). Teachers instructing English language learners follow a method of [pedagogical grammar](https://www.thoughtco.com/pedagogical-grammar-1691600) for their students.

## intimating someone vs informing someone

The phrases "intimating someone" and "informing someone" have distinct meanings, although they both involve conveying information to another person. Here's the difference:

### Informing someone

- Definition: Informing someone means providing them with facts, details, or knowledge about a particular subject or situation. It is a straightforward and clear communication of information.
- Objective: The primary purpose of informing someone is to educate, update, or share information in a direct and transparent manner.
- Tone: It is often done in a neutral, factual, and straightforward tone. The focus is on the information itself, and there is no hidden agenda or implied meaning.

Example: "I want to inform you that the meeting has been rescheduled to next Monday at 3:00 PM."

### Intimating someone

- Definition: Intimating someone involves communicating information indirectly or subtly. It may include hinting at or suggesting something without explicitly stating it. Intimation often requires the recipient to read between the lines or discern the underlying message.
- Objective: The objective of intimating someone is typically to convey a message in a more subtle or discreet way, often to avoid direct confrontation or to encourage the recipient to draw their conclusions.
- Tone: Intimation can involve a tone that is less direct, possibly hinting at emotions, feelings, or a hidden meaning. It may be used in situations where diplomacy or tact is required.

Example: "I've noticed that your performance has room for improvement, and we should discuss it sometime soon."

In summary, the key difference between these two terms lies in their directness and clarity. "Informing someone" is a straightforward and clear communication of facts, while "intimating someone" is a more indirect or subtle way of conveying a message that may require the recipient to interpret the underlying meaning. The choice between these approaches depends on the context and the desired level of transparency in the communication.
