# Figures of Speech

A word or phrase used in a non-literal sense for rhetorical or vivid effect

## Rhetoric

Is the art of using speech to convince or persuade.

The art of effective or persuasive speaking or writing, especially the exploitation of figures of speech and other compositional techniques.

### Rhetorical question

With no expectation of having the audience answer his or her question audibly.

A rhetorical question is where the point of the question is to make a point rather than to get an answer.

Example - "How many times do I have to tell you to stop stealing my cookies?" (Rhetorical. The point of the question is to show I'm annoyed at you for stealing my cookie.)

### Non-Rhetorical question

Would be a question posed by a speaker which requires some sort of response from an audience.

Example - "Where did you put my cookies?" (Non-rhetorical. I would like an answer as to where my cookie is.)

In a narrower sense, analogy is an [inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference) or an [argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_argument) from one particular to another particular, as opposed to [deduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning), [induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning), and [abduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning), in which at least one of the [premises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premise), or the conclusion, is general rather than particular in nature. The term analogy can also refer to the relation between the source and the target themselves, which is often (though not always) a [similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(philosophy)), as in the [biological notion of analogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogy_(biology)).
