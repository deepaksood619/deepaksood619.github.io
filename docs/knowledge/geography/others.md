## South Korea - Hermit Kingdom

The term **hermit kingdom** is used to refer to any country, organization or society which willfully walls itself off, either metaphorically or physically, from the rest of the world. In the current geopolitical order, the [East Asian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia) country of [North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea) is regarded as a prime example of a hermit kingdom, and the term is contemporarily used to describe that nation state.
