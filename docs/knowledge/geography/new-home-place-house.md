Housing isn’t a great investment but for most people, it’s the best investment they will ever make because it’s the only asset they will leave alone and let compound for 10, 20, 30 years.

## Questions

- Why people have false ceilings

## Places/Place to live

[**Where on Earth Will People Live in the Future? | Parag Khanna | TED**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSevAi_YarQ)

**20-30 degrees Celsius with no humidity throughout year i.e dry climate**

### Elevation / Altitude

One of the factor is Elevation

- 500 mtr+ is good weather like bangalore (964m), pune (565m), jagdalpur (570m), nainital (1990m)
- 300 mtr is bad - delhi (246m), dantewada (370m), ramnagar (388m)

As we increase elevation, there is less air above us thus the pressure decreases. As the pressure decreases, air molecules spread out further (i.e. air expands) and the temperature decreases.

[As we go to higher altitudes, what happens to the temperature?](https://byjus.com/question-answer/as-we-go-to-higher-altitudes-what-happens-to-the-temperature-it-increasesit-remains-constantit/)

When we move up a hill, we notice a fall in temperature. This fall in temperature with elevation is primarily due to two reasons.

1. With the increase in elevation, the atmospheric **pressure falls**. Fall in pressure implies that the temperature also falls (Pressure is directly proportional to Temperature and vice versa)
2. With the increase in elevation, the **concentration of greenhouse gases decreases** (Water vapor and carbon dioxide fall sharply with elevation). Hence the heat absorption capacity of the atmosphere will also decrease.

## Buying vs Renting Home

Unrecoverable cost of owning vs buying

Property Taxes, Maintenance costs, cost of capital

Take the value of the home that you are considering multiply by 5% and divide by 12

**Never buy a home, don't buy a land too**

- **Land is not that scarce, world has too much land (Africa is 9 times of India)**
- because house depreciates in value, but land appreciates in value
- land is a commodity, house is a consumer good

### Factors

- access to freshwater
- availability of food
- proximity to healthcare facilities
- withstand extreme weather events
- Areas that are less prone to extreme weather events, such as inland areas or regions at higher elevations, may be more resilient to climate change impacts than coastal regions or low-lying areas that are vulnerable to sea-level rise and flooding

### India

1. The Himalayan region: This region includes states like Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh, which are at higher elevations and have access to freshwater sources. These areas are also less prone to extreme weather events, such as cyclones and floods, that can impact coastal regions. Additionally, these states have a strong tradition of organic farming and have relatively better healthcare facilities compared to other parts of the country.
2. The Deccan Plateau: This region covers a large part of central and southern India, including states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana. This area is relatively more stable climatically and has access to groundwater sources. The Deccan Plateau is also known for its agriculture and food production, including the cultivation of crops such as rice, wheat, and pulses.
3. The North-Eastern region: This region includes states like Assam, Meghalaya, and Nagaland and has access to water resources such as the Brahmaputra and Barak rivers. This region is less prone to extreme weather events, although some areas are prone to landslides and floods. Additionally, the region has a high biodiversity and a rich cultural heritage.

### International

1. Iceland, which is relatively less vulnerable to the impacts of climate change compared to many other countries. Iceland has a small population, abundant renewable energy resources, and access to freshwater. Additionally, Iceland has a strong focus on environmental conservation and sustainable practices, which have helped to mitigate the impacts of climate change in the country.
2. Canada, which has a vast land area and diverse geography that may provide some resilience to climate change impacts. Canada has a relatively small population and abundant freshwater resources, which may be crucial as water scarcity becomes a more significant problem in other parts of the world. Additionally, Canada has taken steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and invest in renewable energy sources, which may help to mitigate the impacts of climate change.
3. ~~Australia, New Zealand,~~ and certain countries in Europe such as Germany or Denmark
