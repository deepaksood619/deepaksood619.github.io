## Celiac Disease - https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/38085.php

Celiac disease is a chronic digestive disorder resulting from an immune reaction to gliadin, a gluten protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and sometimes oats.

[Celiac disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celiac_disease)(CD) is a chronic, multiple-organ [autoimmune disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disorder) primarily affecting the [small intestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine) caused by the ingestion of wheat, barley, rye, oats, and derivatives, that appears in [genetically predisposed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition) people of all ages.CD is not only a gastrointestinal disease, because it may involve several organs and cause an extensive variety of non-gastrointestinal symptoms, and most importantly, it may be apparently asymptomatic.Many asymptomatic people actually are not, but have become accustomed to living with a chronic bad health status as if it were normal, and they are able to recognize that they actually had symptoms related to celiac disease after starting the gluten-free diet and improvement is evident, in contrast to the situation prior to the diet.Added difficulties for diagnosis are the fact that serological markers [anti-tissue transglutaminase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-transglutaminase_antibodies#Anti-tissue_transglutaminase](TG2) are not always present and many people may have minor mucosal lesions, without atrophy of the [intestinal villi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_villi).

CD affects approximately 1--2% of the general population, but most cases remain unrecognized, undiagnosed and untreated, and at risk for serious long-term health complications.People may suffer severe disease symptoms and be subjected to extensive investigations for many years, before a proper diagnosis is achieved.Untreated CD may cause [malabsorption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malabsorption), reduced quality of life, [iron deficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_deficiency), [osteoporosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis), an increased risk of intestinal [lymphomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma), and greater mortality. CD is associated with some other autoimmune diseases, such as [diabetes mellitus type 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1), [thyroiditis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroiditis), [gluten ataxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia), [psoriasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriasis), [vitiligo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitiligo), [autoimmune hepatitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_hepatitis), [dermatitis herpetiformis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis_herpetiformis), [primary sclerosing cholangitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_sclerosing_cholangitis), and more.

CD with "classic symptoms", which include gastrointestinal manifestations such as chronic diarrhea and abdominal distention, malabsorption, loss of appetite, and impaired growth, is currently the least common presentation form of the disease and affects predominantly small children generally younger than two years of age.

CD with "non-classic symptoms" is the most common clinical typeand occurs in older children (over 2 years old), adolescents, and adults.It is characterized by milder or even absent gastrointestinal symptoms and a wide spectrum of non-intestinal manifestations that can involve any organ of the body, and very frequently may be completely asymptomaticboth in children (at least in 43% of the cases) and adults.

## Non-celiac gluten sensitivity

Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is described as a condition of multiple symptoms that improves when switching to a [gluten-free diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten-free_diet), after celiac disease and wheat allergy are excluded. Recognized since 2010, it is included among [gluten-related disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten-related_disorders).Its [pathogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis) is not yet well understood, but the activation of the innate immune system, the direct negative effects of gluten and probably other wheat components, are implicated.

NCGS is the most common syndrome of [gluten intolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten_intolerance), with a prevalence estimated to be 6-10%. NCGS is becoming a more common diagnosis, but its true prevalence is difficult to determine because many people self-diagnose and start a gluten-free diet, without having previously tested for celiac disease or having the dietary prescription from a physician.People with NCGS and gastrointestinal symptoms remain habitually in a "no man's land", without being recognized by the specialists and lacking the adequate medical care and treatment.Most of these people have a long history of health complaints and unsuccessful consultations with numerous physicians, trying to get a diagnosis of celiac disease, but they are only labeled as [irritable bowel syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome).A consistent although undefined number of people eliminate gluten because they identify it as responsible for their symptoms and these improve with the [gluten-free diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten-free_diet), so they self-diagnose as NCGS.

People with NCGS may develop gastrointestinal symptoms, which resemble those of [irritable bowel syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome) or [wheat allergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_allergy), or a wide variety of non-gastrointestinal symptoms, such as [headache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache), chronic [fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)), [fibromyalgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibromyalgia), [atopic diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy), [allergies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy), [neurological diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder), or [psychiatric disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder), among others.The results of a 2017 study suggest that NCGS may be a chronic disorder, as is the case with celiac disease.

Besides gluten, additional components present in wheat, rye, barley, oats, and their derivatives, including other proteins called amylase-trypsin inhibitors (ATIs) and short-chain [carbohydrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrates) known as [FODMAPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FODMAP), may cause NCGS symptoms. As of 2019, reviews conclude that although FODMAPs present in wheat and related grains may play a role in non-celiac gluten sensitivity, they only explain certain gastrointestinal symptoms, such as [bloating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloating), but not the [extra-digestive symptoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-celiac_gluten_sensitivity#Extraintestinal) that people with non-celiac gluten sensitivity may develop, such as [neurological disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder), [fibromyalgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibromyalgia), psychological disturbances, and [dermatitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis).ATIs may cause toll-like receptor 4 ([TLR4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLR4))-mediated intestinal [inflammation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation) in humans.

## Lactose Intolerance

People with lactose intolerance cannot metabolize lactose properly, because their digestive system produces too little of an enzyme known as lactase. If they consume foods containing lactose, they may experience bloating, flatulence, and diarrhea.

- **Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)** are primarily produced by gut bacteria through the fermentation of dietary fiber in the large intestine. These SCFAs, including acetate, propionate, and butyrate, are crucial for maintaining gut health and have implications for overall well-being.
