# Alternative Medicine

**Alternative medicine** is any practice that aims to achieve the healing effects of [medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine "Medicine") despite lacking [biological plausibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_plausibility "Biological plausibility"), [testability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testability "Testability"), [repeatability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeatability "Repeatability") or evidence of effectiveness.

## Homeopathy

Homeopathy is a system of medicine that treats the individual with medicines that stimulate the body's self-healing mechanisms to restore its natural equilibrium

**Homeopathy** or **homoeopathy** is a [pseudoscientific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscientific "Pseudoscientific") system of [alternative medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine "Alternative medicine"). It was conceived in 1796 by the German physician [Samuel Hahnemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Hahnemann "Samuel Hahnemann"). Its practitioners, called **homeopaths**, believe that a substance that causes symptoms of a disease in healthy people can cure similar symptoms in sick people; this doctrine is called _[similia similibus curentur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similia_similibus_curentur "Similia similibus curentur")_, or "like cures like". Homeopathic preparations are termed _remedies_ and are made using [homeopathic dilution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathic_dilution "Homeopathic dilution"). In this process, the selected substance is repeatedly diluted until the final product is chemically indistinguishable from the [diluent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diluent "Diluent"). Often not even a single molecule of the original substance can be expected to remain in the product. Between each dilution homeopaths may hit and/or shake the product, claiming this makes the diluent remember the original substance after its removal. Practitioners claim that such preparations, upon oral intake, can treat or cure disease.

All relevant scientific knowledge about physics, chemistry, biochemistry and biology contradicts homeopathy. Homeopathic remedies are typically [biochemically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry "Biochemistry") inert, and have no effect on any known disease. Its theory of disease, centered around principles Hahnemann termed [miasms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathy#Miasms_and_disease), is inconsistent with subsequent identification of viruses and bacteria as [causes of disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory_of_disease "Germ theory of disease"). Clinical trials have been conducted and generally demonstrated no objective effect from homeopathic preparations. The fundamental implausibility of homeopathy as well as a lack of demonstrable effectiveness has led to it being characterized within the scientific and medical communities as [quackery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quackery "Quackery") and [fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud "Fraud").

In the 21st century, a series of meta-analyses have shown that the therapeutic claims of homeopathy lack scientific justification. As a result, national and international bodies have recommended the withdrawal of government funding for homeopathy in healthcare. National bodies from Australia, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and France, as well as the European Academies' Science Advisory Council and the Russian Academy of Sciences have all concluded that homeopathy is ineffective, and recommended against the practice receiving any further funding. The National Health Service in England no longer provides funding for homeopathic remedies and asked the Department of Health to add homeopathic remedies to the list of forbidden prescription items. France removed funding in 2021, while Spain has also announced moves to ban homeopathy and other pseudotherapies from health centers.

## Acupressure / Acupuncture

**Acupressure** is an [alternative medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine "Alternative medicine") technique often used in conjunction with [acupuncture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture "Acupuncture") or [reflexology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexology "Reflexology"). It is based on the concept of life energy, which flows through "meridians" in the body. In treatment, physical pressure is applied to [acupuncture points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture_point "Acupuncture point"), or ashi [trigger points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myofascial_trigger_point "Myofascial trigger point"), with the aim of clearing blockages in these meridians. Pressure may be applied by hand, by elbow, or with various devices.

Although some medical studies have suggested that acupressure may be effective at helping manage nausea and vomiting, [insomnia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomnia "Insomnia"), [low back pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_back_pain "Low back pain"), [migraines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migraine "Migraine"), and [constipation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation "Constipation"), among other things, such studies have been found to have a high likelihood of [bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias "Bias"). There is no reliable evidence for the effectiveness of acupressure.

Acupressure therapy was prevalent in India. After the [spread of Buddhism to China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Buddhism#Han_Dynasty_(206_BCE%E2%80%93220_CE) "Chinese Buddhism"), the acupressure therapy was also integrated into common medical practice in China and it came to be known as **acupuncture**. Scholars note these similarities because the major points of Indian acupressure and Chinese acupuncture are similar to each other.
