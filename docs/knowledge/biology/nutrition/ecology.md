## Cereal

Acerealis any [grass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaceae) cultivated (grown) for the edible components of its [grain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain)(botanically, a type of [fruit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit) called a [caryopsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caryopsis)), composed of the [endosperm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endosperm), [germ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal_germ), and [bran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bran). The term may also refer to the resulting grain itself (specifically "cereal grain"). Cereal [grain crops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_grain) are grown in greater quantities and provide more food energy worldwide than any other type of cropand are therefore [staple crops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staple_food). Edible grains from other plant families, such as [buckwheat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckwheat) ([Polygonaceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygonaceae)), [quinoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinoa) ([Amaranthaceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaranthaceae)) and [chia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvia_hispanica)([Lamiaceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamiaceae)), are referred to as [pseudocereals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocereal).

In their natural, unprocessed, [whole grain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_grain) form, cereals are a rich source of [vitamins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin), [minerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_mineral), [carbohydrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate), [fats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat), oils, and [protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_(nutrient)). When processed by the removal of the bran, and germ, the remaining [endosperm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endosperm) is mostly [carbohydrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate). In some [developing countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country), grain in the form of [rice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice), [wheat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat), [millet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millet), or [maize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize) constitutes a majority of daily sustenance. In [developed countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country), cereal consumption is moderate and varied but still substantial.

The wordcerealis derived from [Ceres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(Roman_mythology)), the Roman goddess of harvest and agriculture.

## Pseudocereal

Apseudocerealis one of any non-grasses that are used in much the same way as [cereals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal)(true cereals are [grasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasses)). Their seed can be ground into [flour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flour) and otherwise used as cereals. Examples of pseudocereals are [amaranth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaranth_grain)([Love-lies-bleeding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love-lies-bleeding_(plant)), [red amaranth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_amaranth), [Prince-of-Wales-feather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince-of-Wales-feather)), [quinoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinoa), and [buckwheat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckwheat).
