# Honey

1. Honey is the only food that has every single substance to sustain life.
2. Honey doesn't ever turn bad. You can actually eat honey that was found in Egyptian tombs thousands of years ago. (if you dare) ‚ÄºÔ∏è
3. A single bee produces just HALF a teaspoon of honey in its lifetime. Hard work.
4. The darker the honey, the more powerful its medicinal properties and the less sweet it is. The inverse also holds true.
5. Honey is the original antibiotic. It's been used as an antibacterial and antifungal for generations.
6. Honey is a natural sleeping pill. Consuming honey aids with the production of melatonin. Drink a warm cup of chamomile and take a shot of honey to the dome. Game changer.
7. You don't need to wash your honey dipper if you leave it in the jar of honey itself. Honey is a natural preservative, so bacteria will not grow.
8. To make one pound of honey, bees need to visit 2 million flowers. 2 MILLION.
9. Honey is the only food made by an insect that's actually eaten by BOTH the insect and us. We're literally best friends.
10. Honey is one of the original remedies for an everyday cough & allergies. Local honey is said to be useful in curing seasonal allergies.
11. Bees don't sleep. Work hard. Play hard.
12. Honey is excellent on burns. Cool the burn in running water. Pat it dry. Apply raw, organic honey. It will speed up healing and even reduce any eventual scarring.
13. Babies under 12 months of age shouldn't ingest honey (their immune system isn't yet strong enough to handle a certain strain of bacteria that's quite prevalent in honey)
14. Honey, like a lot of "animal-based" products have a myriad of topical and oral applications that make it incredibly versatile. Nature's all purpose drug.
15. The only honey that exists in my world is raw, organic unfiltered honey. To pasteurize honey is to ruin the work of thousands of bees. You are literally a war criminal.
16. Everyone raves about Manuka honey, but the real ones have tried Jarrah. If you know, you know.
17. Honey is one of the best hydration sources in the world. Honey > Pre Workout.
18. Honey is nature's moisturizer.
19. Royal jelly is a special compound that worker bees secret; so potent it can transform an ordinary bee into a queen bee. It's like a concentrated, supercharged version of honey.
20. The honey bee is a crucial part of our ecosystem. Without their help, over a third of all food eaten in America wouldn't exist.
21. Honey should be a key ingredient in shampoos. Cleopatra did it. Why shouldn't we?
22. Bees communicate with other bees by dancing. That's how they signal where the best flowers are. Seems familiar...
23. Honey is a source of flavanoids and phenolic acids - antioxidants which have been studied to have incredible anti-inflammatory and even anti-cancer properties.
24. The hexagonal shape of honeycomb cells is a MARVEL. How did they know to use hexagons? Hexagons are the most efficient shape to store the maximum amount of honey with the least amount of wax needed to build. Geniuses.

### To the anti-honey community

- When we eat honey we are NOT stealing from bees. It's a symbiotic relationship. We protect them from the harsh conditions of nature, giving them a safe space to have their fun and make their vomit.
- They are so happy that they usually produce more honey than they could ever physically consume. By consuming their excess honey, we are actually helping them restore balance in the hive.
- So yes people, eat more honey. Buy all the varieties. Gift it to everyone around you. And always remember to give thanks to our wonderful striped yellow friends üêùü•Ç
