# Essentiality

## Essential nutrients

An**essential nutrient** is a nutrient required for normal physiological function that cannot be synthesized in the body-- either at all or in sufficient quantities-- and thus must be obtained from a [dietary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)) source.Apart from [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water), which is universally required for the maintenance of [homeostasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis) in mammals, essential nutrients are indispensable for various cellular [metabolic processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_process) and maintaining tissue and organ function.In the case of humans, there are nine [amino acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid), two [fatty acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid), thirteen [vitamins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin) and fifteen [minerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_(nutrient)) that are considered essential nutrients.In addition, there are several molecules that are considered conditionally essential nutrients since they are indispensable in certain developmental and pathological states.

## Amino acids

An essential amino acid is an [amino acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid) that is required by an organism but cannot be synthesized [*de novo*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_novo_synthesis) by it, and therefore must be supplied in its diet. Out of the twenty standard protein-producing amino acids, nine cannot be [endogenously](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous) synthesized by humans:[phenylalanine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylalanine), [valine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valine), [threonine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threonine), [tryptophan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan), [methionine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine), [leucine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucine), [isoleucine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoleucine), [lysine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysine), and [histidine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histidine).

## Fatty acids

Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are [fatty acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid) that humans and other animals must ingest because the body requires them for good health but cannot [synthesize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosynthesis) them.Only two fatty acids are known to be essential for humans:[alpha-linolenic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-linolenic_acid)(an [omega-3 fatty acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-3_fatty_acid)) and [linoleic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linoleic_acid)(an [omega-6 fatty acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-6_fatty_acid)).

## Vitamins

Vitamins are organic molecules essential for an organism that are not classified as [amino acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid) or [fatty acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid). They commonly function as [enzymatic cofactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzymatic_cofactor), metabolic regulators or [antioxidants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant). Humans require **thirteen vitamins** in their diet.

## Vitamins (Total - 13)

1. Water Soluble - B's and C

2. Fat Soluble - A, D, E, K (ADEK)

Vitamin A

Vitamin B (total - 8) - B1 (thiamine), B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin), B5 (pantothenic acid), B6 (pyridoxine), B7 (biotin), B9 (folate), B12 (cobalamin)

Vitamin C

Vitamin D

- Keeps bones healthy by increasing the absorption of calcium in the intestines. Without vitamin D, your body would only be able to absorb about 10% to 15% of the calcium from your diet.

- The requirement for vitamin D is conditional, as people who get sufficient exposure to ultraviolet light, either from the sun or an artificial source, synthesize vitamin D in the skin.

Vitamin E (includes [tocopherols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tocopherol) and [tocotrienols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tocotrienol))

Vitamin K

## Minerals

Minerals are the [exogenous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogenous)[chemical elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element) indispensable for life. Although the four elements:[carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon), [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen), [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen), and [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen), are essential for life, they are so plentiful in food and drink that these are not considered nutrients and there are no recommended intakes for these as minerals. The need for nitrogen is addressed by requirements set for protein, which is composed of nitrogen-containing amino acids.[Sulfur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur) is essential, but again does not have a recommended intake. Instead, recommended intakes are identified for the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine.

The essential nutrient elements for humans, listed in order of [Recommended Dietary Allowance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_Daily_Intake) (expressed as a mass), are [potassium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium), [chlorine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine), [sodium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium), [calcium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium), [phosphorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus), [magnesium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium), [iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron), [zinc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc), [manganese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganese), [copper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper), [iodine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine), [chromium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium), [molybdenum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molybdenum), [selenium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium) and [cobalt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt) (the last as a component of vitamin B~12~). There are other minerals which are essential for some plants and animals, but may or may not be essential for humans, such as [boron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boron) and [silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon).

## Conditionally essential nutrients

Conditionally essential nutrients are certain organic molecules that can normally be synthesized by an organism, but under certain conditions in insufficient quantities. In humans, such conditions include [premature birth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth), limited nutrient intake, rapid growth, and certain disease states.[Choline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choline), [inositol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inositol), [taurine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurine), [arginine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine), [glutamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamine) and [nucleotides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotides) are classified as conditionally essential and are particularly important in neonatal diet and metabolism.

## Non-essential nutrients

Non-essential nutrients are substances within foods that can have a significant impact on health; these substances can be beneficial or toxic.For example, [dietary fiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_fiber) is not absorbed in the human digestive tract, but is important in maintaining the bulk of a [bowel movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_movement) to avoid [constipation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation). A subset of dietary fiber, [soluble fiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soluble_fiber), can be metabolized by bacteria residing in the large intestine. Soluble fiber is marketed as serving a [prebiotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prebiotic_(nutrition)) function-- promoting "healthy" intestinal bacteria. Bacterial metabolism of soluble fiber also produces [short-chain fatty acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-chain_fatty_acid) like [butyric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butyric_acid), which may be absorbed into intestinal cells as a source of calories.

## Non-nutrients

## Ethanol

[Ethanol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol)(C~2~H~5~OH) supplies calories. For spirits (vodka, gin, rum, etc.) a standard serving in the United States is 1.5 US fluid ounces (44ml), which at 40%ethanol (80proof) would be 14 grams and 98 calories. At 50%alcohol, 17.5grams and 122.5calories. Wine and beer contain a similar amount of ethanol in servings of 5 US fluid ounces (150ml) and 12 US fluid ounces (350ml), respectively, but these beverages also contain non-ethanol calories. A 5-ounce serving of wine contains 100 to 130 calories. A 12-ounce serving of beer contains 95 to 200 calories. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, based on [NHANES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHANES) 2013--2014 surveys, women ages 20 and up consume on average 6.8grams of alcohol per day and men consume on average 15.5 grams per day. Ignoring the non-alcohol contribution of those beverages, the average ethanol calorie contributions are 48 and 108 cal/day, respectively.Alcoholic beverages are considered [empty calorie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_calorie) foods because, other than calories, they contribute no essential nutrients.

## Phytochemicals

By definition, [phytochemicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytochemical) include all nutritional and non-nutritional components of edible plants.Included as nutritional constituents are [provitamin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provitamin) A [carotenoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotenoid), whereas those without nutrient status are diverse [polyphenols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphenol), [flavonoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavonoid), [resveratrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resveratrol), and [lignans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lignan)-- often claimed to have [antioxidant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant) effects -- that are present in numerous plant foods. A number of phytochemical compounds are under preliminary research for their potential effects on human diseases and health., the qualification for nutrient status of compounds with poorly defined properties [*in vivo*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo) is that they must first be defined with a [Dietary Reference Intake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_Reference_Intake) level to enable accurate food labeling, a condition not established for most phytochemicals that are claimed to be antioxidant nutrients.

## Proteins

- **Whey protein:**Whey protein is a milk protein that is quickly absorbed by the body, making it useful before or after your workout. It also contains bioactive proteins that may offer other [health benefits](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-health-benefits-of-whey-protein).
- **Casein protein:**Casein is the other milk protein that digests much slower than whey, making it ideal during periods of fasting like sleep. What's more, some brands of casein protein offer up to 60% of your RDA for calcium per scoop.
- **Egg protein:**Egg protein powders are made with pure egg white protein. They digest at a medium rate and are one of the most expensive protein supplements on the market.
- **Soy protein:**Soy protein is one of the few plant proteins that contains all of the essential amino acids, making it a complete protein source for vegetarians.
- **Rice and pea protein:**Rice and pea proteins do not contain all of the essential amino acids, but combining them makes them a complete protein. They are low-allergenic, making them appealing to those with egg, dairy or soy allergies.
