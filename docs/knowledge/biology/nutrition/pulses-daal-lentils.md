- Split - Dhuli Massor Daal

It does not need soaking prior to cooking as it is a "soft" daal and cooks quickly.

- It cooks faster compared to sabut moong dal due to its split form.
- Hari moong dal is also rich in protein, fiber, and various nutrients.

Toor/tuvar or arhar daal, is most commonly sold and cooked in its split, skinless form. With its skin on, it is a greenish-brown color and without its skin, yellow.

## Split urad with skin

![image](../../../media/Nutrition_Pulses-Daal-Lentils-image7.jpg)

Urad daal, can be bought whole with its skin on, split with its skin on or split with its skin removed.

This [black lentil](https://www.thespruceeats.com/what-are-lentils-1328630) has a creamy white interior when split. Whole and with its skin on, it is known assaabuturadand has a stronger, more distinct flavor than the split, skinless variety. It is a "harder" lentil and takes longer to cook. A little soaking is best prior to ​cooking this daal.

![image](../../../media/Nutrition_Pulses-Daal-Lentils-image8.jpg)

## Moth Dal (Matki Dal / Turkish Gram)

- Soak for 5 hours

![moth dal](../../../media/Pasted%20image%2020240227082926.jpg)

## Kulthi Dal (Horse Gram)

![kulthi dal](../../../media/Pasted%20image%2020240227083043.jpg)

## Kabuli chana

![image](../../../media/Nutrition_Pulses-Daal-Lentils-image9.jpg)

Also known aschole, garbanzo beans, Egyptian peas and white chickpeas, kabulichana, has a lovely nutty flavor. In India, it is used to make curries, added to salads and even in dips.

Kabuli chana is especially popular in North India. It must be soaked for several hours before cooking as it is a "very hard" bean. You can also use canned kabuli chana which is easily available in supermarkets these days but nothing beats the taste of kabuli chana freshly soaked and boiled just before cooking.

## Lobia or chawli (Black eyed pea / Cowpea)

![image](../../../media/Nutrition_Pulses-Daal-Lentils-image10.jpg)

There is no need to soaklobiaorchawli, because it is a relatively "soft" bean that cooks easily. Watch carefully when cooking as it should not get mashed.

Lobia can be used almost similarly to kabulichana (white chickpeas) even though it tastes different.

## Rajma

![image](../../../media/Nutrition_Pulses-Daal-Lentils-image11.jpg)

Slightly larger than the Mexican red bean, rajma or red kidney beans are very popular in North India where a well-loved dish is named after them. Not only do they taste great on their own, they make a terrific combination when cooked with vegetables and meats too.

Rajma must be soaked for several hours before cooking to soften it. As with all beans (like kabuli chana, lobia, etc.) that are high in fiber and full of nutrition, rajma has gas-producing enzymes. The trick to beating this is to change the soaking water every few hours (before cooking) and cook them until soft.

### Toxicity

Red kidney beans contain relatively high amounts of [phytohemagglutinin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytohemagglutinin "Phytohemagglutinin"), and thus are more toxic than most other bean varieties if not pre-soaked and subsequently heated to the boiling point for at least 10 minutes. The US [Food and Drug Administration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration "Food and Drug Administration") recommends boiling for 30 minutes to ensure they reach a sufficient temperature long enough to completely destroy the toxin. Cooking at the lower temperature of 80 °C (176 °F), such as in a [slow cooker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_cooker "Slow cooker"), is insufficient to denature the toxin and has been reported to cause food poisoning.

### Chana dal

In India, chana dal are used to make chickpea flour, while in the United States, the larger kabuli chick-peas are used for flour. Chana dal can be found in Indian stores and some specialty food shops.

Chana daal, looks like a larger version of toor/tuvar or arhar daal. It is made by splitting a smaller cousin of the chickpea.

This [lentil](https://www.thespruceeats.com/history-of-lentils-1807624) has a nutty flavor and is used in dry curries or with vegetables or meats and also as a flour (Bengal gram flour). It cooks fairly quickly and does not need soaking prior to being cooked.

![image](../../../media/Nutrition_Pulses-Daal-Lentils-image15.jpg)

- **Chickpea flour:** Chickpea flour has a rich culinary tradition in Indian cuisine, where it is known as **besan or chana** and is used in pancakes, stews, and curries. It is popular as well in Italian cuisine where **farina di ceci(chickpea flour)** is used to make pasta and a polenta-like dish. Chickpeas are also used in some blended flours, such as **garfava flour**, a combination of chickpeas and fava beans, and **dhokra flour**, a combination of rice, lentils, and chickpeas.
- **Green chickpeas:** Fresh and sweet, like green peas, these are young, tender, fresh chickpeas. They are predominantly found in local farmers' markets.
