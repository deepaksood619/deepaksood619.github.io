## Tips

- Freeze the onion for 15 minutes right before chopping. If you can’t do that, peel the onion and wash it in cold, running water before cutting it. These methods lower the temperature and slow down the sulphur release.
- Microwave the garlic pods for 15 seconds before peeling. This slight heating will make the peels drop right off!
- Got someone at home who can’t tolerate the heat of green chillies? There’s a simple fix. The heat comes mainly from the white central portion of the chilly to which seeds are attached. Discard that part and use the green/red bits for lower heat.
