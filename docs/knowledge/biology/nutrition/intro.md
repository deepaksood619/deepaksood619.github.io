Biohacking

A nutrienis a [substance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance) used by an organism to survive, grow, and reproduce. The requirement for dietary nutrient intake applies to [animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal), [plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant), [fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus), and [protists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist). Nutrients can be incorporated into cells for [metabolic purposes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism) or [excreted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion) by cells to create non-cellular structures, such as [hair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair), [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)), [feathers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feather), or [exoskeletons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoskeleton). Some nutrients can be metabolically converted to smaller molecules in the process of releasing energy, such as for [carbohydrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate), [lipids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid), [proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_(nutrient)), and [fermentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation) products ([ethanol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol) or [vinegar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinegar)), leading to end-products of water and [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide). All organisms require water. Essential nutrients for animals are the energy sources, some of the [amino acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid) that are combined to create [proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein), a subset of [fatty acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid), [vitamins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin) and certain [minerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_(nutrient)).

Different types of organism have different essential nutrients. Ascorbic acid ([vitamin C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C)) is essential, meaning it must be consumed in sufficient amounts, to humans and some other animal species, but not to all animals and not to plants, which are able to synthesize it. Nutrients may be [organic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound) or inorganic: organic compounds include most compounds containing carbon, while all other chemicals are inorganic. Inorganic nutrients include nutrients such as [iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron), [selenium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium), and [zinc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc), while organic nutrients include, among many others, energy-providing compounds and vitamins# Macronutrient

Consumed in relatively large amounts ([grams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram) or [ounces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ounce)), macronutrients ([carbohydrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate), [fats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat), proteins, water) are used primarily to generate energy or to incorporate into tissues for growth and repair.

Macronutrients are defined in several ways.

- The [chemical elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element) humans consume in the largest quantities are [carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon), [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen), [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen), [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen), [phosphorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus), and [sulphur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulphur), summarized as [CHNOPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHNOPS).
- The chemical compounds that humans consume in the largest quantities and provide bulk energy are classified as [carbohydrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate), [proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein), and [fats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat). Water must be also consumed in large quantities.
- [Calcium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium), [sodium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium), [potassium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium), [magnesium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium), and [chloride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloride) ions, along with phosphorus and sulfur, are listed with [macronutrients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_macronutrients) because they are required in large quantities compared to [micronutrients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronutrient), i.e., vitamins and other minerals, the latter often described as trace or ultratrace minerals.

Macronutrients provide energy:

- [Carbohydrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate) are compounds made up of types of [sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar). Carbohydrates are classified according to their number of sugar units:[monosaccharides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monosaccharide)(such as [glucose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose) and [fructose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructose)), [disaccharides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaccharide) (such as [sucrose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucrose) and [lactose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose)), [oligosaccharides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligosaccharide) (3 to 10 of monosaccharides), and [polysaccharides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysaccharide)(such as [starch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starch), [glycogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen), and [cellulose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulose)).
  - Complex carbohydrates
  - Simple carbohydrates
- [Proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein) are [organic compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound) that consist of [amino acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid) joined by [peptide bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide_bond). Since the body cannot manufacture some of the [amino acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid)(termed [essential amino acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_amino_acid)), the diet must supply them. Through digestion, [proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein) are [broken down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_catabolism) by [proteases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease) back into free amino acids.
- [Fats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat) consist of a [glycerin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycerin) molecule with three [fatty acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid) attached. Fatty acid molecules contain a -COOH group attached to unbranched [hydrocarbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon) chains connected by single bonds alone ([saturated fatty acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat)) or by both double and single bonds ([unsaturated fatty acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsaturated_fat)). Fats are needed for construction and maintenance of [cell membranes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane), to maintain a stable body temperature, and to sustain the health of skin and hair. Because the body does not manufacture certain fatty acids (termed [essential fatty acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_fatty_acid)), they must be obtained through one's diet.

Fat has an [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy) content of 9 [kcal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kcal)/g (~37.7 kJ/g) and proteins and carbohydrates 4kcal/g (~16.7 kJ/g).

### Types

#### Saturated fat - Single bond between their molecules

- Solid at room temperature
- Butter, Cheese

#### Un-saturated fat - One or more double or triple bond between the molecules

- Liquid at room temperature
- Olive oil, Sunflower oil

#### Trans fat

- Natural trans fat (Meat)
- Artificial trans fat (Industrial, Partially hyderogenerated fats)

#### Visceral body fat

Visceral body fat, also known as 'hidden' fat, is **fat stored deep inside the belly, wrapped around the organs, including the liver and intestines**. It makes up about one tenth of all the fat stored in the body.

#### Subcutaneous fat

Most fat is stored underneath the skin and is known as subcutaneous fat.

## Micronutrient

Micronutrients are needed in smaller amounts ([milligrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milligram) or [micrograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microgram)); they have subtle [biochemical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry) and [physiological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology) roles in cellular processes, like [vascular functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_smooth_muscle) or [nerve conduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential).

Micronutrients support metabolism.

- [Dietary minerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_mineral) are generally trace elements, salts, or ions such as copper and iron. Some of these minerals are essential to human metabolism.
- [Vitamins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin) are organic compounds essential to the body. They usually act as [coenzymes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coenzyme) or [cofactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cofactor_(biochemistry)) for various proteins in the body.

## Gluten

Gluten is a protein naturally found in some [grains](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/whole-grains/) including wheat, barley, rye, and spelt. It acts like a binder, holding food together and adding a "stretchy" quality - think of a pizza maker tossing and stretching out a ball of dough. Without gluten, the dough would rip easily.

Wheat products, such as bread, baked goods, crackers, cereals, and pasta, commonly contain gluten. It is also an ingredient in barley-based products, including malt, food coloring, malt vinegar, and beer.
