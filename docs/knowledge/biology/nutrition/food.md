## Eating patterns

[Should you skip timely meals and eat only when you are hungry?](https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/food-wine/hunger-meal-food-time-dr-bm-hegde-nutrition-9272928/)

### Meal-eaters vs grazers

- Eating 3 meals of 800 calories will cause the same thermic effect as eating 6 meals of 400 calories. There is literally no difference.
- Multiple studies have compared eating many smaller versus fewer larger meals and concluded that there is no significant effect on either metabolic rate or the total amount of fat lost
- Fewer and larger meals lower your average daily blood sugar levels. Getting most of your calories in the morning and eating fewer in the afternoon and evening also seems to reduce average blood sugar levels.
- Skipping meals every now and then helps you lose weight and may improve your blood sugar control over time.

## Eight principles of low-glycemic eating

7. Eat a lot of non-starchy vegetables, beans, and fruits such as apples, pears, peaches, and berries. Even tropi- cal fruits like bananas, mangoes, and papayas tend to have a lower glycemic index than typical desserts

8. Eat grains in the least-processed state possible: "unbroken," such as whole-kernel bread, brown rice, and whole barley, millet, and wheat berries; or tra- ditionally processed, such as stone-ground bread, steel-cut oats, and natural granola or muesli breakfast cereals

9. Limit white potatoes and refined grain products such as white breads and white pasta to small side dishes.

10. Limit concentrated sweets - including high-calorie foods with a low glycemic index, such as ice cream - to occasional treats. Reduce fruit juice to no more than one cup a day. Completely eliminate sugar-sweetened drinks

11. Eat a healthful type of protein, such as beans, fish, or skinless chicken, at most meals

12. Choose healthful fats, such as olive oil, nuts (almonds, walnuts, pecans), and avocados. Limit saturated fats from dairy and other animal products. Completely eliminate partially hydrogenated fats (trans fats), which are in fast food and many packaged foods

13. Have three meals and one or two snacks each day, and don't skip breakfast

14. Eat slowly and stop when full

## Fruits

## Vitamins

They decide how our skin looks. How strong our bones are. How we fight infections. Whether we wake up happy or grumpy. Vitamins wield immense power over our bodies and minds. What’s more, Bigbasketeer, vitamin deficiencies can have some pretty serious consequences. Reason enough to take a closer look at them?

Vitamins are...

15. A group of compounds

    There are 13 vitamins in all: A, C, D, E, K, and the B-complex of 8 vitamins

16. Micronutrients

    We need them in tiny quantities (milli or micrograms). Unlike carbs/proteins, which are macronutrients.

17. Essential nutrients

    They’re not produced directly by our bodies but supplied from our food (with a few exceptions.)

#### Vitamin supplements: Good or Bad?

When it comes to vitamins, there is such a thing as too much. Every vitamin has a recommended daily intake and you can get this from a healthy, diverse diet. But if you’re eating fortified foods and taking supplements (often ordered online without checking dosage or composition), you may consume more than you need.

So, unless you have a diagnosed deficiency, get your vitamins from food. There is evidence that this has better health outcomes overall!

### Your guide to a vitamin-rich diet

#### Vitamin A

Important for

- Growth
- Immunity
- Skin & bone formation
- Reproductive health
- Eyesight

Get it from

- Orange/yellow produce (carrots, red capsicum, mango, papaya, pumpkin)
- Green leafy veggies
- Eggs

#### Vitamin B Complex

Important for

- Metabolism
- DNA synthesis
- Nervous system function
- RBC creation

Get it from

- Seafood, meat & poultry
- Eggs & dairy
- Legumes (beans, lentils)
- Green leafy veggies
- Beetroot

#### Vitamin C

Important for

- Collagen for skin & hair
- Immunity
- Antioxidant properties

Get it from

- Citrus fruits
- Kiwi & amla
- Potato & tomato
- Green leafies
- Cruciferous veggies (cabbage, gobi, broccoli)

#### Vitamin E

Important for

- Skin & hair
- Eyesight
- Antioxidant properties

Get it from

- Nuts and seeds such as almonds, sunflower seeds, and peanuts
- Egg yolks
- Whole grains
- Green leafy veggies

#### Vitamin K

Important for

- Bone health
- Blood clotting & wound healing

Get it from

- Green leafy vegetables
- Avocado
- Kiwi

Wondering what happened to vitamins B4, B8, B10, and B11? They got the boot! As scientists’ understanding of vitamins evolved, these were no longer regarded as vitamins. Reminds you of Pluto, huh?

#### Vitamin D

We saved it for the last because it’s kinda special! Vitamin D has many roles to play-blood pressure regulation, bone growth, calcium balance, hormone production, immune health, nervous system function etc.

Unlike the others, vitamin D can be produced by our bodies, provided our skin is exposed to adequate sunshine. Unfortunately, most of us don’t get enough time in the sun and hence, are D-deficient.

**Make Vit D while the sun shines**

Try to get 10-20 minutes of sunlight ideally before noon, 3-4 times a week. Darker skin needs more sun than lighter skin; so adjust your sun exposure based on your need.

##### Food

- fatty fish
- Egg Yolk
- fortified cereals
fortified milk and juices
yogurt
beef liver

## Infused Water

**Tooth Enamel Erosion** - Many infused water recipes include citrus fruits, which are known to wear away tooth enamel due to their acidic content. Frequently drinking citrus-infused water could lead to tooth sensitivity or cavities, so be sure to infuse your water with other fruits from time to time.

**Shelf Life** - Over time, fruit-infused water will go bad, but it will last longer when stored in the refrigerator. If you leave it out at room temperature, it’s best to consume it within four hours. But, if you’re storing it in the refrigerator, it will stay fresh for about three days.

## Sugarcane Juice

Despite providing some nutrients, sugarcane juice is still high in sugar and carbs. In 240 mL of sugarcane juice will contain the following ingredients:

Calories: 183. Protein: 0 grams. Fat: 0 grams. Sugar: 50 grams - equivalent to 12 teaspoons. Fiber: 0-13 grams. The sugar content in 240mL of sugarcane juice is 50 grams - equivalent to 12 teaspoons, significantly more than the total daily sugar recommended by the American Heart Association respectively for men (9 teaspoons). and women (6 teaspoons).

Although sugarcane juice is classified as a low glycemic index (GI) beverage, it is still high in glycemic index (GL) - meaning it has a definite impact on your blood sugar levels.

### Sugarcane juice has a concise shelf life

It can become toxic and inedible quickly; when stored for more than 20 minutes, sugarcane oxidises, this can be extremely harmful to your body. Oxidation acts like a poison and facilitates various stomach problems. Therefore, freshly made sugarcane juice is the safest to consume sugarcane!

## Others

### Inset Fragments

**Insect fragments** are a natural and unavoidable part of many foods due to their presence during growth, harvesting, and processing. Food authorities generally consider these fragments as natural contaminants that don't pose a health risk. For example, a 16-ounce jar of peanut butter can legally contain up to 136 insect parts before being considered contaminated.

Common Foods with Insect Fragments:

- **Peanut Butter:** Can contain up to 136 insect parts per 16-ounce jar.
- **Wheat Flour:** The FDA has a defect action level of 75 insect fragments per 50g of flour.
- **Cinnamon:** The FDA allows an average of 400 or more insect fragments per 50 grams.
- **Tomato Sauce:** The FDA allows an average of 30 or more fly eggs per 100 grams.
- **Coffee Beans:** Insects can be found in various stages of growth within coffee berries.
- **Fruit Juices:** Juices can be made with fruit that may contain insect fragments.
- **Dried Fruits:** Weevils can infest and multiply in dried fruits.
- **Spices:** Spices like cinnamon, pepper, and others can contain insect fragments.

It's nearly impossible to completely eliminate insect fragments during large-scale food production.
