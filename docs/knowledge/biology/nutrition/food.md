## Eating patterns

## Meal-eaters vs grazers

- Eating 3 meals of 800 calories will cause the same thermic effect as eating 6 meals of 400 calories. There is literally no difference.
- Multiple studies have compared eating many smaller versus fewer larger meals and concluded that there is no significant effect on either metabolic rate or the total amount of fat lost
- Fewer and larger meals lower your average daily blood sugar levels. Getting most of your calories in the morning and eating fewer in the afternoon and evening also seems to reduce average blood sugar levels.
- Skipping meals every now and then helps you lose weight and may improve your blood sugar control over time.

- Vegetables: Vary your vegetables. Eat more dark green veg- etables like broccoli and spinach. Eat more orange vegetables like carrots and sweet potatoes. Eat more dry beans and peas

- Fruits: Eat a variety of fruits. Choose fresh, frozen, canned, or dried fruit. Go easy on fruit juices, which have high sugar content without much fiber

- Milk: Eat calcium-rich foods. Choose low-fat or fat-free dairy products. If you don't drink milk or eat dairy products, choose lactose-free products or other calcium sources such as fortified foods and drinks

- Meat and beans: Eat lean proteins. Choose low-fat or lean cuts of meat and poultry. Bake, broil, or grill your meats. Eat more fish, beans, peas, nuts, and seeds

- Protein - 16% of your daily energy intake
- Fibre > 30 grams per day
- Free sugar < 5 per cent of your daily energy intake

## Eight principles of low-glycemic eating

1. Eat a lot of non-starchy vegetables, beans, and fruits such as apples, pears, peaches, and berries. Even tropi- cal fruits like bananas, mangoes, and papayas tend to have a lower glycemic index than typical desserts

2. Eat grains in the least-processed state possible: "unbroken," such as whole-kernel bread, brown rice, and whole barley, millet, and wheat berries; or tra- ditionally processed, such as stone-ground bread, steel-cut oats, and natural granola or muesli breakfast cereals

3. Limit white potatoes and refined grain products such as white breads and white pasta to small side dishes.

4. Limit concentrated sweets - including high-calorie foods with a low glycemic index, such as ice cream - to occasional treats. Reduce fruit juice to no more than one cup a day. Completely eliminate sugar-sweetened drinks

5. Eat a healthful type of protein, such as beans, fish, or skinless chicken, at most meals

6. Choose healthful fats, such as olive oil, nuts (almonds, walnuts, pecans), and avocados. Limit saturated fats from dairy and other animal products. Completely eliminate partially hydrogenated fats (trans fats), which are in fast food and many packaged foods

7. Have three meals and one or two snacks each day, and don't skip breakfast

8. Eat slowly and stop when full

## Vitamins

They decide how our skin looks. How strong our bones are. How we fight infections. Whether we wake up happy or grumpy. Vitamins wield immense power over our bodies and minds. What’s more, Bigbasketeer, vitamin deficiencies can have some pretty serious consequences. Reason enough to take a closer look at them?

Vitamins are...

1. A group of compounds

    There are 13 vitamins in all: A, C, D, E, K, and the B-complex of 8 vitamins

2. Micronutrients

    We need them in tiny quantities (milli or micrograms). Unlike carbs/proteins, which are macronutrients.

3. Essential nutrients

    They’re not produced directly by our bodies but supplied from our food (with a few exceptions.)

#### Vitamin supplements: Good or Bad?

When it comes to vitamins, there is such a thing as too much. Every vitamin has a recommended daily intake and you can get this from a healthy, diverse diet. But if you’re eating fortified foods and taking supplements (often ordered online without checking dosage or composition), you may consume more than you need.

So, unless you have a diagnosed deficiency, get your vitamins from food. There is evidence that this has better health outcomes overall!

### Your guide to a vitamin-rich diet

Wondering what happened to vitamins B4, B8, B10, and B11? They got the boot! As scientists’ understanding of vitamins evolved, these were no longer regarded as vitamins. Reminds you of Pluto, huh?

#### Wait, what about Vitamin D?

We saved it for the last because it’s kinda special! Vitamin D has many roles to play-blood pressure regulation, bone growth, calcium balance, hormone production, immune health, nervous system function etc.
Unlike the others, vitamin D can be produced by our bodies, provided our skin is exposed to adequate sunshine. Unfortunately, most of us don’t get enough time in the sun and hence, are D-deficient. ☹️

**Make Vit D while the sun shines**

Try to get 10–20 minutes of sunlight ideally before noon, 3-4 times a week. Darker skin needs more sun than lighter skin; so adjust your sun exposure based on your need.
