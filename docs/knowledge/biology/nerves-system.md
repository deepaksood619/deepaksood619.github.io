# Nerves System

Your cranial nerves are pairs of nerves that connect your [brain](https://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/brain) to different parts of your head, neck, and trunk. There are 12 of them, each named for their function or structure.

Each nerve also has a corresponding Roman numeral between I and XII. This is based off their location from front to back. For example, your olfactory nerve is closest to the front of your head, so it's designated as I.

Their functions are usually categorized as being either sensory or motor. Sensory nerves are involved with your senses, such as smell, hearing, and touch. Motor nerves control the movement and function of muscles or glands.
