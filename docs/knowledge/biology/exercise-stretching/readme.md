## BDNF

Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is a protein, encoded by the BDNF gene, that promotes neuronal growth, survival, and function, particularly through the regulation of synaptic plasticity, which is crucial for learning and memory. It is a member of the neurotrophin family and exerts its effects by binding to receptors like TrkB, influencing complex behaviors and serving as a potential therapeutic target for neurological and psychiatric disorders.

When our muscles and other tissues are active during exercise, the body releases a protein called Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF).

BDNF is sometimes called a “fertilizer” for the brain: it facilitates the growth of new neurons, supports dendritic branching (the connections between neurons), and helps existing neurons survive and function properly. BDNF has been strongly linked with healthy hippocampal neurogenesis.

### Which exercises best boost neurogenesis?

Exercise is not just to build muscles, it can also boost neurogenesis. Dr. Love has emphasized that not all exercise is equal when it comes to maximizing BDNF release and stimulating neurogenesis. Recently, he attended a neurology conference where Dr. Austin Perlmutter shared evidence that **resistance training** (lifting weights, body-weight exercises, etc.) might outperform aerobic training in some respects when the goal is BDNF release and neuroprotection, especially in older adults or those at risk for Alzheimer’s.
