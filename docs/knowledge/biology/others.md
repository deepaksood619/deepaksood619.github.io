## Autophagy

Autophagy (or autophagocytosis) (from the Ancient Greek) αὐτόφαγοςautóphagos, meaning "self-devouring" andκύτοςkýtos, meaning "hollow") is the natural, regulated mechanism of the cell that disassembles unnecessary or dysfunctional components.It allows the orderly degradation and recycling of cellular components

## Angiogenesis

Physiological process through which new blood vessels form from per-existing vessels, formed in the earlier stage of vasculogenesis.

- Vital process in growth and development, as well as in wound healing and in the formation of granulation tissue

## Tomography

Tomography is [imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image)by sections or sectioning, through the use of any kind of penetrating [wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave). The method is used in [radiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology),[archaeology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology),[biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology),[atmospheric science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_science),[geophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics),[oceanography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanography),[plasma physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_physics),[materials science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_science),[astrophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics),[quantum information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information), and other areas of science. The word *tomography* is derived from Ancient Greek τόμος *tomos*, "slice, section" and γράφω*graphō*, "to write" (see also[Etymology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology)). A device used in tomography is called a **tomograph**, while the image produced is a tomogram

3. Protein problems
4. Epigenetic alterations
5. Senescent cells
6. Malfunctioning mitochondria
7. Signalling changes
8. Microbiome changes
9. Cellular exhaustion
10. Immune malfunction
