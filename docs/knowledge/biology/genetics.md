# Genetics

## Phenotype

Thephenotype(from [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language) phainein, meaning 'to show', andtypos, meaning 'type') of an organism is the composite of the [organism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism)'s observable characteristics or [traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_(biology)), including its [morphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)) or physical form and structure; its [developmental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology) processes; its biochemical and physiological properties; its [behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior), and the products of behavior, for example, a bird's nest. An organism's phenotype results from two basic factors: the [expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression) of an organism's genetic code, or its [genotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype), and the influence of environmental factors, which may interact, further affecting phenotype. When two or more clearly different phenotypes exist in the same population of a species, the species is called [polymorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)). A well-documented polymorphism is [Labrador Retriever coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labrador_Retriever_coat_colour_genetics); while the coat color depends on many genes, it is clearly seen in the environment as yellow, black and brown.[Richard Dawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins) in 1978and then again in his 1982 book [The Extended Phenotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Extended_Phenotype) suggested that bird nests and other built structures such as [caddis fly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddis_fly) larvae cases and [beaver dams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver_dam) can be considered as "extended phenotypes".

The [genotype-phenotype distinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype-phenotype_distinction) was proposed by [Wilhelm Johannsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Johannsen) in 1911 to make clear the difference between an organism's [heredity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity) and what that heredity produces.The distinction is similar to that proposed by [August Weismann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Weismann), who distinguished between [germ plasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_plasm)(heredity) and [somatic cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_cell)(the body).

The genotype-phenotype distinction should not be confused with [Francis Crick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Crick)'s [central dogma of molecular biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology), which is a statement about the directionality of molecular sequential information flowing from DNA to protein, and not the reverse.

## Allele

An allele is a variant form of a gene. Some genes have a variety of different forms, which are located at the same position, or genetic locus, on a chromosome. Humans are called diploid organisms because they have two alleles at each genetic locus, with one allele inherited from each parent. Each pair of alleles represents the genotype of a specific gene. Genotypes are described as homozygous if there are two identical alleles at a particular locus and as heterozygous if the two alleles differ. Alleles contribute to the organism's phenotype, which is the outward appearance of the organism.

Some alleles are dominant or recessive. When an organism is heterozygous at a specific locus and carries one dominant and one recessive allele, the organism will express the dominant phenotype. Alleles can also refer to minor DNA sequence variations between alleles that do not necessarily influence the gene's phenotype.

## Epigenetics

Epigeneticsis the study of heritable [phenotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype) changes that do not involve alterations in the [DNA sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequence).The [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek) prefix [epi-](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/epi-)([ἐπι-](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%90%CF%80%CE%B9-#Ancient_Greek)"over, outside of, around") in epigenetics implies features that are "on top of" or "in addition to" the traditional [genetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene) basis for inheritance. Epigenetics most often denotes changes that affect gene activity and [expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression), but can also be used to describe any heritable phenotypic change. Such effects on [cellular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)) and [physiological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology)[phenotypic traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait) may result from external or [environmental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)) factors, or be part of normal development. The standard definition of epigenetics requires these alterations to be heritable, in the progeny of either cells or organisms.

The term also refers to the changes themselves: functionally relevant changes to the genome that do not involve a change in the [nucleotide sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide_sequence). Examples of mechanisms that produce such changes are [DNA methylation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation) and [histone modification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_modification), each of which alters how genes are expressed without altering the underlying [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA) sequence. Gene expression can be controlled through the action of [repressor proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repressor_protein) that attach to [silencer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silencer_(DNA)) regions of the DNA. These epigenetic changes may last through [cell divisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_division) for the duration of the cell's life, and may also last for multiple generations even though they do not involve changes in the underlying DNA sequence of the organism; instead, non-genetic factors cause the organism's genes to behave (or "express themselves") differently.

One example of an epigenetic change in [eukaryotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryotic) biology is the process of [cellular differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation). During [morphogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphogenesis), [totipotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totipotent)[stem cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cells) become the various [pluripotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluripotent) [cell lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_line) of the [embryo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo), which in turn become fully differentiated cells. In other words, as a single fertilized egg cell -- the [zygote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygote)-- continues to [divide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis), the resulting daughter cells change into all the different cell types in an organism, including [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurons), [muscle cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_cells), [epithelium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium), [endothelium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium) of [blood vessels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessels), etc., by activating some genes while inhibiting the expression of others.

Historically, some phenomena not necessarily heritable have also been described as epigenetic. For example, the term epigenetic has been used to describe any modification of chromosomal regions, especially histone modifications, whether or not these changes are heritable or associated with a phenotype. The consensus definition now requires a trait to be heritable for it to be considered epigenetic.
