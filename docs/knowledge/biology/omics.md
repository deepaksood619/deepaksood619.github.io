# Omics

The branches of [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science") known informally as **omics** are various disciplines in [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology") whose names end in the suffix _[-omics](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-omics "wikt:-omics")_, such as [genomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics "Genomics"), [proteomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteomics "Proteomics"), [metabolomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolomics "Metabolomics"), [metagenomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagenomics "Metagenomics"), [phenomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomics "Phenomics") and [transcriptomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptomics "Transcriptomics"). Omics aims at the collective characterization and quantification of pools of biological molecules that translate into the structure, function, and dynamics of an organism or organisms.

## multiomic sequencing

Multiomic sequencing is a biological analysis approach that combines data sets from different omic groups. These omic groups include the genome, proteome, transcriptome, epigenome, and microbiome.

Multiomics is also known as integrative omics, "panomics", or "pan-omics". It provides a more complete understanding of how genetic variants contribute to biology and disease.

Single-cell multi-omics technologies and methods can characterize cell states and activities by integrating various single-modality omics methods. These methods profile the transcriptome, genome, epigenome, epitranscriptome, proteome, metabolome, and other omics.

Multi-omic single cell sequencing has helped create high-resolution cellular and molecular maps in the context of kidney disease.
