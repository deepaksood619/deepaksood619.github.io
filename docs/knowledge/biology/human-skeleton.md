# Human Skeleton

Thehuman skeletonis the internal framework of the body. It is composed of around 270 [bones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone) at birth -- this total decreases to around 206 bones by adulthood after some bones get fused together.The bone mass in the skeleton reaches maximum [density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density) around age 21. The human skeleton can be divided into the [axial skeleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_skeleton) and the [appendicular skeleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendicular_skeleton). The axial skeleton is formed by the [vertebral column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_vertebral_column), the [rib cage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rib_cage), the [skull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skull) and other associated bones. The appendicular skeleton, which is attached to the axial skeleton, is formed by the [shoulder girdle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder_girdle), the [pelvic girdle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvic_girdle) and the bones of the upper and lower limbs.

The human skeleton performs six major functions; support, movement, protection, production of [blood cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cells), storage of minerals, and endocrine regulation.

The human skeleton is not as [sexually dimorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism) as that of many other primate species, but subtle differences between sexes in the [morphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)) of the [skull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skull), [dentition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentition), [long bones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_bone), and pelvis exist. In general, female skeletal elements tend to be smaller and less robust than corresponding male elements within a given population. The human [female pelvis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_pelvis) is also different from that of males in order to facilitate [childbirth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth).Unlike most primates, human males do not have [penile bones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penile_bone).

## Skeletal Divisions

## Axial skeleton

The axial skeleton (80 bones) is formed by the [vertebral column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_vertebral_column)(32--34 bones; the number of the vertebrae differs from human to human as the lower 2 parts, sacral and coccygeal bone may vary in length), a part of the [rib cage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rib_cage)(12 pairs of [ribs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib) and the [sternum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sternum)), and the [skull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skull)(22 bones and 7 associated bones).

The upright posture of humans is maintained by the axial skeleton, which transmits the weight from the head, the trunk, and the upper extremities down to the lower extremities at the [hip joints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_joint). The bones of the spine are supported by many ligaments. The [erector spinae muscles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erector_spinae_muscles) are also supporting and are useful for balance.

## Appendicular skeleton

The appendicular skeleton (126 bones) is formed by the pectoral girdles, the upper limbs, the pelvic girdle or pelvis, and the lower limbs. Their functions are to make locomotion possible and to protect the major organs of digestion, excretion and reproduction.

## Functions

The skeleton serves six major functions: support, movement, protection, production of blood cells, storage of minerals and endocrine regulation.

## List of bones

## Spine (vertebral column)

A fully grown adult features 26 bones in the spine, whereas a child can have 33.
