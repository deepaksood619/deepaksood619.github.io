# LSAT

LSAT (Law School Admission Test) (Score - 120 to 180, above 160 is good)

The test consists of five 35-minute sections ofmultiple-choice questions. Four of the five sections contribute to the test taker's score.

The LSAT is designed to measure skills that are considered essential for success in law school: the reading and comprehension of complex texts with accuracy and insight; the organization and management of information and the ability to draw reasonable inferences from it; the ability to think critically; and the analysis and evaluation of the reasoning and arguments of others.

There are three multiple-choice question types in the LSAT:

- [Reading comprehension questions](https://www.lsac.org/jd/lsat/prep/reading-comprehension) measure the ability to read, with understanding and insight, examples of lengthy and complex materials similar to those commonly encountered in law school.
- [Analytical reasoning questions](https://www.lsac.org/jd/lsat/prep/analytical-reasoning) measure the ability to understand a structure of relationships and to draw logical conclusions about that structure.
- [Logical reasoning questions](https://www.lsac.org/jd/lsat/prep/logical-reasoning) assess the ability to analyze, critically evaluate, and complete arguments as they occur in ordinary language.

Common wrong choices are

- **Too narrow**(focus on a detail rather than the big picture)
- **Too strong or extreme**(go further than what can be supported by the passage)
- **Beyond the scope**of what is presented in the passage
- In **conflict** withthe passage in some way
