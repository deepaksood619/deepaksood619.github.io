## Thoughts

Useless laws weaken the necessary laws'. The maxim conceptualised by French historian and philosopher Baron de Montesquieu illuminates the legal landscape in India's political economy. The distinction between what is necessary and what is useless is trapped in a fog of perceived intent and perpetuation of fear. The result is: criminalisation of entrepreneurship and of business entities

## Indemnification

Clause in a employment contract, where if the code that you have written causes some problem, then the client cannot sue you for the code, it should sue the company that has employed you.

## Order to show cause

An order to show cause is a type of [court order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_order) that requires one or more of the parties to a case to justify, explain, or prove something to the [court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court). Courts commonly use orders to show cause when the [judge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge) needs more information before deciding whether or not to issue an order requested by one of the parties.For example, if a party requests that the court find another party in contempt of an existing court order, the judge will typically issue an "Order to Show Cause Re Contempt" to the party accused of being in [contempt of court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_court). At the [hearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(law)) on the order to show cause concerning contempt the judge will take [evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence) from both sides concerning the alleged failure to comply with the court order.[Appellate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellate) courts often issue orders to show cause to lower courts requesting that the lower court explain why the [appellant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellant) should not be granted the relief requested by the [writ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writ) or [appeal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal). An order to show cause is always an interim order (because it is never the first nor the final action in a legal action).

## Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)

The **Digital Millennium Copyright Act** (**DMCA**) is a 1998 United States [copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright "Copyright") [law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law "Law") that implements two 1996 treaties of the [World Intellectual Property Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Intellectual_Property_Organization "World Intellectual Property Organization") (WIPO). It criminalizes production and dissemination of technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent measures that control access to [copyrighted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright "Copyright") works (commonly known as [digital rights management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management "Digital rights management") or DRM). It also criminalizes the act of circumventing an [access control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control "Access control"), whether or not there is actual [infringement of copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement "Copyright infringement") itself. In addition, the DMCA heightens the penalties for copyright infringement on the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet"). Passed on October 12, 1998, by a unanimous vote in the [United States Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate "United States Senate") and signed into law by President [Bill Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton "Bill Clinton") on October 28, 1998, the DMCA amended [Title 17 of the United States Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_17_of_the_United_States_Code "Title 17 of the United States Code") to extend the reach of copyright, while limiting the [liability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_liability "Legal liability") of the [providers of online services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_service_provider "Online service provider") for copyright infringement by their users.

## Data Room / Virtual Data Room (VDR)

A data room is a secure place to store and share confidential documents, usually for legal proceedings or business transactions.

[Data room - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_room)

A virtual data room (sometimes called a VDR or Deal Room) is an online repository of information that is used for the storing and distribution of documents. In many cases, a virtual data room is used to facilitate the due diligence process during an M&A transaction, loan syndication, or private equity and venture capital transactions. This due diligence process has traditionally used a physical data room to accomplish the disclosure of documents. For reasons of cost, efficiency and security, virtual data rooms have widely replaced the more traditional physical data room.
