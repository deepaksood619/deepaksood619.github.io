## Order to show cause

Anorder to show causeis a type of [court order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_order) that requires one or more of the parties to a case to justify, explain, or prove something to the [court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court). Courts commonly use orders to show cause when the [judge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge) needs more information before deciding whether or not to issue an order requested by one of the parties.For example, if a party requests that the court find another party in contempt of an existing court order, the judge will typically issue an "Order to Show Cause Re Contempt" to the party accused of being in [contempt of court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_court). At the [hearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(law)) on the order to show cause concerning contempt the judge will take [evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence) from both sides concerning the alleged failure to comply with the court order.[Appellate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellate) courts often issue orders to show cause to lower courts requesting that the lower court explain why the [appellant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellant) should not be granted the relief requested by the [writ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writ) or [appeal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal). An order to show cause is always an interim order (because it is never the first nor the final action in a legal action).
