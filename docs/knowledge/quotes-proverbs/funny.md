Once i was travelling by train from Mumbai to Delhi!

When the train started, I was traveling alone in the AC-I coupe.

Some time later, a Beautiful lady came and sat in the opposite berth!

I was pleasantly Happy🙂

The lady kept smiling at me...

This made me even more Happy☺

Then she went and sat next to me....

I was bubbling with Joy😊😍🤗

She then leant towards me and whispered in my ear...

Hand over all your cash, cards and mobile phone to me , else I will shout loudly and tell everybody that you are harassing and misbehaving with me

I stared blankly at her 🙄

I took out a paper and a pen from my bag and wrote "I am sorry, I can not hear or speak... Please write on this paper whatever you want to say"

The lady wrote everything what she said earlier and gave it to me!

I took her note, kept it nicely in my pocket...

I got up and told her in clear tones..."

Now shout & scream !!

Moral of the story : *DOCUMENTATION IS VERY IMPORTANT*
