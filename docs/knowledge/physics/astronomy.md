## Azimuth

The direction of a celestial object from the observer, expressed as the angular distance from the north or south point of the horizon to the point at which a vertical circle passing through the object intersects the horizon

## Asterism

In [observational astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_astronomy), anasterismis a popularly-known stationary pattern or group of [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) that are recognised in the [night sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_sky) as viewed from Earth. This colloquial definitionmakes it appear quite similar to a [constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation), but they differ mostly in that a constellation is an [officially recognized area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/88_modern_constellations) of the sky, while an asterism is a visually obvious collection of stars and the lines used to mentally connect them; as such, asterisms do not have officially determined boundaries and are therefore a more general concept which may refer to any identified pattern of stars. This distinction between terms remains somewhat inconsistent, varying among published sources. An asterism may be understood as an informal group of stars within the area of an official or defunct [former constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Former_constellations).Some include stars from more than one constellation.

## List

- The [Great Diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Diamond) consisting of [Arcturus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcturus), [Spica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spica), [Denebola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denebola), and [Cor Caroli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cor_Caroli).An East-West line from Arcturus to Denebola forms an equilateral triangle with Cor Caroli to the North, and another with Spica to the South. The Arcturus, Regulus, Spica triangle is sometimes given the name [Spring Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Triangle).Together these two triangles form the Diamond. Formally, the stars of the Diamond are in the constellations [Boötes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo%C3%B6tes), [Virgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_(constellation)), [Leo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_(constellation)), and [Canes Venatici](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canes_Venatici).
- The [Summer Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Triangle) of [Deneb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deneb), [Altair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair), and [Vega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vega)--- The [Cygni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_(constellation)), The [Aquilae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquila_(constellation)), and The [Lyrae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyra)--- is easily recognized in the northern hemisphere summer skies, as its three stars are all of the 1st magnitude.The stars of the Triangle are in the band of the [Milky Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) which marks the galactic equator, and are in the direction of the galactic center.
- TheGreat Square of [Pegasus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus_(constellation)) is the quadrilateral formed by the stars [Markab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Pegasi), [Scheat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Pegasi), [Algenib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_Pegasi), and [Alpheratz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Andromedae), representing the body of the winged horse.The asterism was recognized as the constellationASH.IKU"The Field" on the [MUL.APIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUL.APIN)[cuneiform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform) tablets from about 1100 to 700 BC.
- One-third of the 1st-magnitude stars visible in the sky (seven of twenty-one) are in the so-called [Winter Hexagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Hexagon) with [Capella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capella_(star)), [Aldebaran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldebaran), [Rigel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigel), [Sirius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius), [Procyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procyon), and [Pollux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollux_(star)) with 2nd-magnitude [Castor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castor_(star)), on the periphery, and [Betelgeuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betelgeuse) off-center.Although somewhat flattened, and thus more elliptical than circular, the figure is so large that it cannot be taken in all at once, thus making the lack of true circularity less noticeable. (The projection in the chart exaggerates the stretching.) Some prefer to regard it as aHeavenly 'G'.
- The [Winter Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Triangle) visible in the northern sky's winter and comprise the first magnitude stars [Procyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procyon), [Betelgeuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betelgeuse) and [Sirius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius).

## Constellation based asterism

- A familiar asterism is the**[Big Dipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dipper), PloughorCharles's Wain,** which is composed of the seven brightest stars in [Ursa Major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Major).These stars delineate the Bear's hindquarters and exaggerated tail, [or alternatively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Major#Graphic_visualisation), the "handle" forming the upper outline of the bear's head and neck. With its longer tail, [Ursa Minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Minor) hardly appears bearlike at all, and is widely known by its pseudonym, theLittle Dipper.
- The [**Northern Cross**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Cross_(asterism)) in [Cygnus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_(constellation)).The upright runs from [Deneb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deneb)(α Cyg) in the Swan's tail to [Albireo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albireo)(β Cyg) in the beak. The transverse runs from [Aljanah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsilon_Cygni)(ε Cyg) in one wing to [Fawaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Cygni)(δ Cyg) in the other.
- The**Fish Hook** is the traditional Hawaiian name for [Scorpius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpius). The image will be even more obvious if the chart's lines from [Antares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antares)(α Sco) to [Graffias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Scorpii)(β Sco) and [Fang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_Scorpii)(π Sco) are replaced with a line from Graffias through [Dschubba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Scorpii)(δ Sco) to Pi forming a large capped "J."
- The**Southern Cross** is an asterism by name, but the whole area is now recognised as the constellation [Crux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crux). The main stars are [Acrux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrux), [Mimosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Crucis), [Gacrux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacrux), [Imai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Crucis), and arguably also, [Ginan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsilon_Crucis). Earlier, Cruxwasdeemed an asterism when Bayer created it in [Uranometria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranometria)(1603) from the stars in the hind legs of [Centaurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaurus), decreasing the size of Centaur. These same stars were probably identified by [Pliny the Elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder) in his [Naturalis Historia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalis_Historia) as the asterism 'Thronos Caesaris.'
- Adding vertical lines to connect the limbs at the left and right in the main diagram of [Hercules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules_(constellation)) will complete the figure of the**Butterfly.**
- Although hardly an ancient notion, it is easy to see why the**Ice Cream Cone**is sometimes applied to [Boötes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo%C3%B6tes). It is even better known as the**Kite.**
- The stars of [Cassiopeia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiopeia_(constellation)) form a **W** which is often used as a nickname.

Some asterisms may also be part of a constellation referring to the traditional figuring of the whole outline. For example, there are:

- [Orion's Belt/The Belt Of Orion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion%27s_Belt)
- TheY in [Aquarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarius_(constellation))(historically called "the Urn")
- [Hercules's Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules_(constellation))

## Orian's Belt / Belt of Orion

The names of the three stars come from Arabic;Alnilam(النظام) means "[string of pearls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl#Pearls_in_jewelry)" or is related to the wordnilam("[sapphire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapphire)") with the spellingsAlnihanandAlnitam, Mintaka means belt.

- Alnitak

Alnitak (ζ Orionis) is a triple star system at the eastern end of Orion's belt and is 1,260 light-years from the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth). Alnitak B is a 4th-magnitude B-type star which orbits Alnitak A every 1,500 years. The primary (Alnitak A) is itself a close binary, comprising Alnitak Aa (a blue supergiant of spectral type O9.7 Ibe and an apparent magnitude of 2.0) and Alnitak Ab (a blue dwarf of spectral type O9V and an apparent magnitude of about 4). Alnitak Aa is estimated as being up to 28 times as massive as the Sun, and to have a diameter 20 times greater. It is the brightest star of class O in the night sky.

- Alnilam

Alnilam (ε Orionis) is a [supergiant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supergiant), approximately 1,340 light-years away from Earth and magnitude 1.70. It is the 29th-brightest star in the sky and the fourth-brightest in Orion. It is 375,000 times more luminous than the Sun.Its spectrum serves as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified.

- Mintaka

Mintaka (δ Orionis) is 1,200 light-years away and shines with magnitude 2.21. Mintaka is 90,000 times more luminous than the Sun. Mintaka is a double star. The two stars orbit around each other every 5.73 days.
