## Wave-particle duality

Wave-particle duality is the concept in [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics) that every [particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle) or [quantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum) entity may be partly described in terms not only of particles, but also of [waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave). It expresses the inability of the [classical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_physics) concepts "particle" or "wave" to fully describe the behavior of [quantum-scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum-scale) objects.

As [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) wrote

It seems as though we must use sometimes the one theory and sometimes the other, while at times we may use either. We are faced with a new kind of difficulty. We have two contradictory pictures of reality; separately neither of them fully explains the phenomena of light, but together they do.

## Hysteresis

the phenomenon in which the value of a physical property lags behind changes in the effect causing it, as for instance when magnetic induction lags behind the magnetizing force.
