## WebAssembly gives us access to a set of low level building blocksthat we can use to construct just about anything you can imagine

WebAssembly is a new type of code that can be run in modern web browsers - it is a low-level assembly-like language with a compact binary format that runs with near-native performance and provides languages such as C/C++ with a compilation target so that they can run on the web. It is also designed to run alongside JavaScript, allowing both to work together.

- Generated by languages like C, C++ and Rust
- Much faster than JavaScript
- Not a replacement for JS, works alongside it
- Next level video games, tools in the browser
