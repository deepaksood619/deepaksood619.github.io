# TLA+

TLA+([pronounced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_alphabet#Letter_names) astee ell a plus, [/ˈtiːɛleɪplʌs/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English)) is a [formal specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_specification) language developed by [Leslie Lamport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport). It is used to design, model, document, and verify [concurrent systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_systems). TLA+has been described as exhaustively-testable [pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode), and its use likened to [drawing blueprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_drawing) for software systems;TLAis an [acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym) for [Temporal Logic of Actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_Logic_of_Actions).

For design and documentation, TLA+fulfills the same purpose as informal [technical specifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_specifications). However, TLA+specifications are written in a formal language of [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic) and mathematics, and the precision of specifications written in this language is intended to uncover design flaws before system implementation is underway.

Since TLA+specifications are written in a formal language, they are amenable to finite [model checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_checking). The model checker finds all possible system behaviours up to some number of execution steps, and examines them for violations of desired [invariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(computer_science)) properties such as [safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(distributed_computing)) and [liveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liveness). TLA+specifications use basic [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory) to define safety (bad things won't happen) and [temporal logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_logic) to define liveness (good things eventually happen).

TLA+is also used to write [machine-checked proofs of correctness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_theorem_proving) both for [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms) and mathematical theorems. The proofs are written in a declarative, hierarchical style independent of any single theorem prover backend. Both formal and informal structured mathematical proofs can be written in TLA+; the language is similar to [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX), and tools exist to translate TLA+specifications to LaTeX documents.

TLA+was introduced in 1999, following several decades of research into a verification method for concurrent systems. A toolchain has since developed, including an [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_development_environment) and distributed model checker. The pseudocode-like language [PlusCal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlusCal) was created in 2009; it [transpiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler) to TLA+and is useful for specifying sequential algorithms. TLA+2was announced in 2014, expanding language support for proof constructs. The current TLA+reference is [The TLA+Hyperbook](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/hyperbook.html) by Leslie Lamport.
