# Scala

Scalais a [general-purpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language)[programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) providing support for [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and a strong [static](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_typing)[type system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system). Designed to be concise, many of Scala's design decisions aimed to address [criticisms of Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Java).

Scala source code is intended to be compiled to [Java bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode), so that the resulting executable code runs on a [Java virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine). Scala provides [language interoperability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_interoperability) with Java, so that libraries written in either language may be referenced directly in Scala or Java code.Like Java, Scala is [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), and uses a curly-brace syntax reminiscent of the [C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)). Unlike Java, Scala has many features of [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) languages like [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)), [Standard ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML) and [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)), including [currying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying), [type inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference), [immutability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutability), [lazy evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation), and [pattern matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching). It also has an advanced type system supporting [algebraic data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type), [covariance and contravariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)), [higher-order types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_type_operator)(but not [higher-rank types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism)), and [anonymous types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_type). Other features of Scala not present in Java include [operator overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_overloading), optional parameters, [named parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_parameter), and [raw strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_string). Conversely, a feature of Java not in Scala is [checked exceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checked_exception), which have proved controversial.

The name Scala is a [portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) ofscalableandlanguage, signifying that it is designed to grow with the demands of its users.

Scala combines object-oriented and functional programming in one concise, high-level language. Scala's static types help avoid bugs in complex applications, and its **JVM and JavaScript runtimes** let you build high-performance systems with easy access to huge ecosystems of libraries.

Scala is a modern multi-paradigm programming language designed to express common programming patterns in a concise, elegant, and type-safe way. Scala has been created by Martin Odersky and he released the first version in 2003. Scala smoothly integrates the features of object-oriented and functional languages.

## Scala Trait

A trait encapsulates method and field definitions, which can then be reused by mixing them into classes. Unlike class inheritance, in which each class must inherit from just one superclass, a class can mix in any number of traits.

Traits are used to define object types by specifying the signature of the supported methods. Scala also allows traits to be partially implemented but traits may not have constructor parameters.

A trait definition looks just like a class definition except that it uses the keywordtrait. The following is the basic example syntax of trait.
