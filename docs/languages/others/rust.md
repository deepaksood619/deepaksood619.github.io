# Rust

Rustis a [multi-paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-paradigm_programming_language)[system programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_programming_language) focused on safety, especially safe [concurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)).Rust is [syntactically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)) similar to [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), but is designed to provide better [memory safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_safety) while maintaining high [performance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_(Computer)).

Rust was originally designed by Graydon Hoare at [Mozilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla) Research, with contributions from Dave Herman, [Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich), and others.The designers refined the language while writing the [Servo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servo_(layout_engine)) layout or [browser engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_engine), and the Rust [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler). The compiler is [free and open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)[dual-licensed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-licensing) under the [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) and [Apache License 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License_2.0).

Rust has been the "most loved programming language" in the [Stack Overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow) Developer Survey every year since 2016.

## Cargo: the Rust build tool and package manager

When you install Rustup you'll also get the latest stable version of the Rust build tool and package manager, also known as Cargo. Cargo does lots of things:

- build your project withcargo build
- run your project withcargo run
- test your project withcargo test
- build documentation for your project withcargo doc
- publish a library to [crates.io](https://crates.io/) withcargo publish
