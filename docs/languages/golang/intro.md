# Intro

Go language is a programming language initially developed at Google in the year 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is a statically-typed language having syntax similar to that of C.

Go is a general-purpose language designed with systems programming in mind.

Programs are constructed using packages, for efficient management of dependencies. Go programming implementations use a traditional compile and link model to generate executable binaries.

Go is fast! Go is extremely fast. The performance is similar to that of Java or C++. For our use case, Go is typically 40 times faster than Python.

## Features

- Concurrent Language
  - Execute concurrently
  - Communicate between executing things concurrently
  - Goroutines are much cheaper than threads
- Garbage collected
- Strong and statically typed
- Fast compile time
- Compile to standalone binaries
- Builds fast at scale
- Goroutines
- Channels
  - Channel are typed values that allow goroutines to synchronize and exchange information.
- Select

The select statement is like a switch, but the decision is based on ability to communicate rather than equal values

- Support for Interfaces and Type embedding.
- Production of statically linked native binaries without external dependencies.

## Features excluded intentionally

- Support for type inheritance
- Support for method or operator overloading
- Support for circular dependencies among packages
- Support for pointer arithmetic
- Support for assertions
- Support for generic programming

## Installing

brew install go
