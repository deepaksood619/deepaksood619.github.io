## vert.x

Vert.x is a tool-kit for building reactive applications on the JVM

Vert.x core contains fairly low-level functionality, including support for HTTP, TCP, file system access, and various other features. You can use this directly in your own applications, and it's used by many of the other components of Vert.x.

Eclipse Vert.x isevent drivenandnon blocking. This means your app can handle a lot of concurrency using a small number of kernel threads. Vert.x lets your app scale with minimal hardware.

## Jackson Annotations

Jackson Annotations is a Java library (`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-annotations`) providing annotations to customize JSON serialization and deserialization. Part of the [FasterXML Jackson data processor](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-annotations), it simplifies mapping Java objects to JSON using tags like `@JsonProperty`, `@JsonIgnore`, and `@JsonTypeInfo` to control field handling.
