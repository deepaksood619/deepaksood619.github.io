# Libraries

## jvisualvm

Visualize memory footprint of java app

Already bundled with jdk

## Quarkus (Supersonic Subatomic Java)

Quarkus tailors your application for GraalVM and HotSpot. Amazingly fast boot time, incredibly low RSS memory (not just heap size!) offering near instant scale up and high density memory utilization in container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes. We use a technique we call compile time boot.

Quarkus is a Cloud Native, (Linux) Container First framework for writing Java applications.

- Container First: Minimal footprint Java applications optimal for running in containers
- Cloud Native: Embraces [12 factor architecture](https://12factor.net/) in environments like Kubernetes.
- Unify imperative and reactive: Brings under one programming model non blocking and imperative styles of development.
- Standards-based: Based on the standards and frameworks you love and use (RESTEasy and JAX-RS, Hibernate ORM and JPA, Netty, Eclipse Vert.x, Eclipse MicroProfile, Apache Camel...)
- Microservice First: Brings lightning fast startup time and code turn around to Java apps
- Developer Joy: Development centric experience without compromise to bring your amazing apps to life in no time

## vert.x

Vert.x is a tool-kit for building reactive applications on the JVM

Vert.x core contains fairly low-level functionality, including support for HTTP, TCP, file system access, and various other features. You can use this directly in your own applications, and it's used by many of the other components of Vert.x.

Eclipse Vert.x isevent drivenandnon blocking. This means your app can handle a lot of concurrency using a small number of kernel threads. Vert.x lets your app scale with minimal hardware.
