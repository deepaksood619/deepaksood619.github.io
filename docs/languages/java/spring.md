## Spring Boot

Spring Boot is a Java-based framework that makes it easier to implement standalone applications or microservices. It is commonly used because it greatly simplifies integration with various products and frameworks. It also contains an embedded web server so there is no need to deploy WAR files.

## Running application

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run

mvn package && java -jar target/UserSmsTracker-1.0.jar
```
