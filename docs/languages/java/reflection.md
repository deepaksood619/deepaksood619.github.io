## Java Reflectionis a*process of examining or modifying the run time behavior of a class at run time*

In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), **reflection** is the ability of a [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) to examine, [introspect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introspection_(computer_science)), and modify its own structure and behavior at [runtime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_time_(program_lifecycle_phase))

Reflection is the ability of classes and objects to examine their own constructors, fields, methods, and so on. It is used usually for backward compatibility, to check if a given method is available for a particular OS version.
