## Jakarta EE

Jakarta EE, formerlyJava Enterprise Edition(Java EE) andJava 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition(J2EE) is a set of specifications, extending [Java SE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_SE) 8with specifications for enterprise features such as [distributed computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing) and [web services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service).Jakarta EE applications are run on [reference runtimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reference_runtime&action=edit&redlink=1), that can be [microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) or [application servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_server), which handle transactions, security, scalability, [concurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)) and management of the components it is deploying.

Jakarta EE is defined by its [specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_specification). The specification defines [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)(application programming interface) and their interactions. As with other [Java Community Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Community_Process) specifications, providers must meet certain conformance requirements in order to declare their products asJakarta EE compliant.

Examples of contexts in which Jakarta EE referencing runtimes are used are:[e-commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce), accounting, banking information systems.
