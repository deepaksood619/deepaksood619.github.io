# JMX

The Java Management Extensions (JMX) API is a standard -developed through the [Java Community Process](http://www.jcp.org/en/home/index) (JCP) as [JSR 3](http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=3)-for managing and monitoring applications and services. It defines a management architecture, design patterns, APIs, and services for building web-based, distributed, dynamic, and modular solutions to manage Java-enabled resources. The JMX APIs make it possible to add manageability to Java-enabled equipment, from web phones to set-top boxes to network devices and servers. Using JMX technology to manage applications and services increases their value to vendors and clients by making applications easier to install, configure, and maintain.

### Overview of JMX Technology

The JMX technology is native to the Java programming language. As a result, it offers natural, efficient, and lightweight management extensions to Java-based functions. It consists of a set of specifications and development tools for managing Java environments and developing state-of-the-art management solutions for applications and services. It provides Java developers with the means to instrument Java code, create smart Java agents, implement distributed management middleware and managers, and easily integrate these solutions into existing management and monitoring systems. The dynamics of the JMX technology architecture enables you to use it to monitor and manage resources as they are implemented and installed. It can also be used to monitor and manage the [Java Virtual Machine (JVM machine)](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/javase/jmx.html#jvm).

Typical uses of the JMX technology include:

- Consulting and changing application configuration
- Collecting statistics about application behavior and making the statistics available
- Notification of state changes and erroneous conditions

### Benefits of JMX Technology

The JMX technology enables Java developers to encapsulate resources as Java objects and expose them as management resources in a distributed environment. The JMX specification lists the following benefits to using it to build a management infrastructure:

- _Manages Java applications and services without heavy investment_: JMX architecture relies on a core managed object server that acts as a management agent and can run on most Java-enabled devices. Java applications can be managed with little impact on their design.
- _Provides a scalable management architecture_: A JMX agent service is independent and can be plugged into the management agent. The component-based approach enables JMX solutions to scale from small footprint devices to large telecommunications switches.
- _Can leverage future management concepts_: It can implement flexible and dynamic management solutions. It can leverage emerging technologies; for example JMX solutions can use lookup and discovery services such as [Jini](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/javase/jmx.html#) network technology, [UPnP](http://www.upnp.org/), and [Service Location Protocol (SLP)](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/jmx/overview/lookup.html#wp997349).
- _Focuses on management_: While JMX technology provides a number of services designed to fit into a distributed environment, its APIs are focused on providing functionality for managing networks, systems, applications, and services.
