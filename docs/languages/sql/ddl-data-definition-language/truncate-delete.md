### Truncate

**TRUNCATE** is a DDL command which removes the contents of the table while leaving the structure in place. Removes all rows from the given table.

Example:

```
truncate table marketing.emailcampaign

BEGIN TRAN
TRUNCATE TABLE tranTest
SELECT * FROM tranTest
ROLLBACK
SELECT * FROM tranTest
```

Performance - 283,897,938 rows truncate - 56.239 sec

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/truncate-table.html "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") empties a table completely. It requires the [`DROP`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_drop) privilege. Logically, [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/truncate-table.html "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is similar to a [`DELETE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/delete.html "15.2.2 DELETE Statement") statement that deletes all rows, or a sequence of [`DROP TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/drop-table.html "15.1.32 DROP TABLE Statement") and [`CREATE TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-table.html "15.1.20 CREATE TABLE Statement") statements.

To achieve high performance, [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/truncate-table.html "15.1.37 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") bypasses the DML method of deleting data. Thus, it does not cause `ON DELETE` triggers to fire, it cannot be performed for `InnoDB` tables with parent-child foreign key relationships, and it cannot be rolled back like a DML operation. However, `TRUNCATE TABLE` operations on tables that use an atomic DDL-supported storage engine are either fully committed or rolled back if the server halts during their operation.

### Delete

**DELETE** is a DML command which removes rows given a WHERE clause

Example:

```
delete from
  marketing.emailcampaign
where
  month = 'January'

BEGIN TRAN
DELETE FROM tranTest
SELECT * FROM tranTest
ROLLBACK
SELECT * FROM tranTest


ALTER TABLE tablename AUTO_INCREMENT = 1
```

## Huge Deletes

- MyISAM will lock the table during the entire operation, thereby nothing else can be done with the table.
- InnoDB won't lock the table, but it will chew up a lot of resources, leading to sluggishness.
- InnoDB has to write the undo information to its transaction logs; this significantly increases the I/O required.
- Replication, being asynchronous, will effectively be delayed (on Replicas) while the DELETE is running.

[How to delete 100 million rows in a MySQL table within 30 minutes? | by Sajeban Antonyrex | Sysco LABS Sri Lanka | Medium](https://medium.com/sysco-labs/how-to-delete-100-million-rows-in-a-mysql-table-within-30-minutes-ba39065e5928)

### Batch Deletion

Perform deletions in smaller batches to avoid long-running transactions and potential locks.

```sql
-- Example: Delete 10,000 rows at a time
SET @batch_size = 10000;

REPEAT
  DELETE FROM your_table
  WHERE condition
  LIMIT @batch_size;
UNTIL ROW_COUNT() = 0
END REPEAT;

```

### Using DELETE with LIMIT

This approach is similar to batch deletions but ensures that each batch is explicitly controlled.

```sql
-- Delete in batches of 10,000 rows
DO
BEGIN
  DECLARE rows_affected INT DEFAULT 1;

  WHILE rows_affected > 0 DO
    DELETE FROM your_table
    WHERE condition
    LIMIT 10000;

    SET rows_affected = ROW_COUNT();
  END WHILE;
END;
```

```bash
pt-archiver --source h=your_host,D=your_db,t=your_table --where "condition" --purge --limit 1000 --commit-each
```

[pt-archiver â€” Percona Toolkit Documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-toolkit/pt-archiver.html)

### Creating a New Table

Create a new table with only the rows you want to keep, then swap the tables.

```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table AS
SELECT * FROM your_table
WHERE NOT condition;

RENAME TABLE your_table TO old_table, new_table TO your_table;

DROP TABLE old_table;
```

### Disable Foreign Key Checks

```sql
SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 0;

-- Perform deletion operations

SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 1;
```

### Using Stored Procedures

```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE BatchDelete()
BEGIN
  DECLARE done INT DEFAULT 0;
  DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND SET done = 1;

  REPEAT
    DELETE FROM your_table
    WHERE condition
    LIMIT 10000;

    IF ROW_COUNT() = 0 THEN
      SET done = 1;
    END IF;
  UNTIL done END REPEAT;
END $$

DELIMITER ;

CALL BatchDelete();
```

### Using a Temporary Table

Copy the rows to keep into a temporary table, truncate the original table, and then reinsert the rows.

```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_table AS
SELECT * FROM your_table
WHERE NOT condition;

TRUNCATE TABLE your_table;

INSERT INTO your_table
SELECT * FROM temp_table;

DROP TEMPORARY TABLE temp_table;
```

### MySQL Event Scheduler

Schedule batch deletions using the MySQL event scheduler.

```sql
CREATE EVENT batch_delete
ON SCHEDULE EVERY 1 MINUTE
DO
  DELETE FROM your_table
  WHERE condition
  LIMIT 10000;
```

### Does size of server matters

The beefiness of the server is not likely to matter.

A big delete needs to

- Locate the rows to delete
- Lock the rows -- to keep others from making a mess
- Save a copy of each row that is being deleted (in case of crash/rollback)
- Update indexes (some of this is delayed until after the `DELETE` completes)
- Clean up the deleted rows (at `COMMIT` time)

Performance issues:

- MySQL does most of this in a single CPU -- so, more cores won't help
- CPU speed is not the gating factor -- anyway, today's CPUs are only slightly faster than decade-old cpus.
- Disk speed matters -- but most machines use SSDs today
- Cloud services "provision" IOPs. This _can_ matter. (But let's try to diminish the number of IOPs _needed_.)
- Disk size does not matter -- well, it does matter if you fill up disk with the old copies of the rows.

That is, a more powerful server won't help much.

What _can_ help is to answer these questions:

- If most of the rows are to be deleted, there is a much faster way
- If the rows being deleted are "old" rows, plan ahead with `PARTITIONing`. (This is viable _only_ if you can replace `DELETE` with `DROP PARTITION`.)
- If the above fail, are you deleting in batches? (A batch of about 1000 rows is nearly optimal. It will be several times as fast as one-at-a-time. And going above 1000 won't buy much, if any, performance.)
