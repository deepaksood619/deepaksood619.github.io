## Basic Questions (SQL Fundamentals)

**Q1.** Fetch all customers who signed up in 2024.  

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM signup_date) = 2024;
```

**Q2.** Get the total number of orders placed by each customer.  

```sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

**Q3.** Find customers who haven’t placed any orders.  

```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_id IS NULL;
```

## Intermediate Questions (Joins, Aggregation, Filtering)

**Q4.** Retrieve top 3 products by total revenue.  

```sql
SELECT p.name, SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price_per_unit) AS revenue
FROM order_items oi
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.name
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

**Q5.** Get total revenue by product category for the current year.  

```sql
SELECT p.category, SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price_per_unit) AS total_revenue
FROM order_items oi
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.order_date) = EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE)
GROUP BY p.category;
```

**Q6.** Find customers who have spent more than ₹10,000 in total.  

```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name
HAVING SUM(o.total_amount) > 10000;
```

## Advanced Questions (Subqueries, CTEs, Window Functions)

**Q7.** Find the latest order for each customer.  

```sql
SELECT customer_id, order_id, order_date
FROM (
  SELECT customer_id, order_id, order_date,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date DESC) AS rn
  FROM orders
) t
WHERE rn = 1;
```

**Q8.** Get the top 5 customers by lifetime value (LTV).  

```sql
SELECT c.name, SUM(o.total_amount) AS ltv
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.name
ORDER BY ltv DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Q9.** Find the percentage contribution of each category to total revenue.  

```sql
WITH category_revenue AS (
  SELECT p.category, SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price_per_unit) AS revenue
  FROM order_items oi
  JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
  GROUP BY p.category
)
SELECT category,
       revenue,
       ROUND(100 * revenue / SUM(revenue) OVER (), 2) AS pct_of_total
FROM category_revenue;
```

## Expert Questions (Optimization, Edge Cases, Tricky Logic)

**Q10.** Identify orders where payment is missing or partial.  

```sql
SELECT o.order_id, o.total_amount, COALESCE(SUM(p.amount), 0) AS paid_amount
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN payments p ON o.order_id = p.order_id
GROUP BY o.order_id, o.total_amount
HAVING COALESCE(SUM(p.amount), 0) < o.total_amount;
```

**Q11.** For each customer, show month-over-month growth in spending.  

```sql
WITH monthly_spend AS (
  SELECT customer_id,
         DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS month,
         SUM(total_amount) AS spend
  FROM orders
  GROUP BY customer_id, DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date)
)
SELECT customer_id,
       month,
       spend,
       spend - LAG(spend) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY month) AS growth
FROM monthly_spend;
```

**Q12.** Find the most popular product category per city.  

```sql
WITH city_category_sales AS (
  SELECT c.city, p.category, SUM(oi.quantity) AS qty
  FROM order_items oi
  JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
  JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
  JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
  GROUP BY c.city, p.category
),
ranked AS (
  SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY city ORDER BY qty DESC) AS rn
  FROM city_category_sales
)
SELECT city, category, qty
FROM ranked
WHERE rn = 1;
```
