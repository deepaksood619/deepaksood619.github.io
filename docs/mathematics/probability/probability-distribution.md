# Probability Distribution

In [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory) and [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics), a**probability distribution** is a mathematical function that provides the probabilities of occurrence of different possible outcomes in an [experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment_(probability_theory)). In more technical terms, the probability distribution is a description of a [random](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness) phenomenon in terms of the [probabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability) of [events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(probability_theory)). For instance, if the [random variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable)*X*is used to denote the outcome of a coin toss ("the experiment"), then the probability distribution of *X* would take the value 0.5 for*X*= heads, and 0.5 for*X*= tails(assuming the coin is fair). Examples of random phenomena can include the results of an [experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment_(probability_theory)) or [survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survey_methodology).

## Discrete Probability Distribution

A **discrete probability distribution** (applicable to the scenarios where the set of possible outcomes is [discrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_probability_distribution), such as a coin toss or a roll of dice) can be encoded by a discrete list of the probabilities of the outcomes, known as a [probability mass function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_mass_function).

## Continuous Probability Distribution

A **continuous probability distribution** (applicable to the scenarios where the set of possible outcomes can take on values in a continuous range (e.g. real numbers), such as the temperature on a given day) is typically described by [probability density functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function) (with the probability of any individual outcome actually being 0).

A probability distribution whose sample space is the set of real numbers is called [univariate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_distribution), while a distribution whose sample space is a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space) is called [multivariate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_distribution). A univariate distribution gives the probabilities of a single [random variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable) taking on various alternative values; a multivariate distribution (a [joint probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_probability_distribution)) gives the probabilities of a [random vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_vector) -- a list of two or more random variables -- taking on various combinations of values. Important and commonly encountered univariate probability distributions include the [binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution), the [hypergeometric distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergeometric_distribution), and the [normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution). The [multivariate normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution) is a commonly encountered multivariate distribution.
