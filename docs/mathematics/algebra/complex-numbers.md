# 2.2 Complex Numbers

1. Principle Square root
2. sq. root(a.b) = sq. root(a) * sq. root(b), iff a and b both are not negative
3. **Complex Number => i^2^ = - 1**

   - Real part
   - Imaginary part
   - Principle Square Root

4. Complex Plane
   - The horizontal number line (what we know as thexxx-axis on a Cartesian plane) is thereal axis.
   - The vertical number line (theyyy-axis on a Cartesian plane) is theimaginary axis.

5. Number Systems

   - Counting number system ( greater than 0)
   - Integer number system (positive and negative numbers)
   - Rational number system (fractions)
   - Real number system (decimals)
   - Complex number system

6. Pure imaginary
7. Adding and subtracting complex numbers
8. Multiplying complex number
9. (a - bi)(a+bi) = a^2^+b^2^**Imaginary Numbers**
