# Chinese Remainder Theorem

The **Chinese remainder theorem** is a theorem of [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory), which states that if one knows the remainders of the [Euclidean division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_division) of an [integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer)*n*by several integers, then one can determine uniquely the remainder of the division of *n* by the product of these integers, under the condition that the [divisors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisor) are [pairwise coprime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairwise_coprime).
