# Cube Cutting

Concepts -

1. Cube has 6 faces, 8 vetices and 12 edges
Number of cubes of size y*y*y formed after cutting a large cube of size x*x*x

= (x/y)^3^
If unit cubes than number of unit cubes formed after cutting a cube of size x = x^3^

## Shortcut Formulae

- For a cube of side n*n*n painted on all sides which is uniformly cut into smaller cubes of dimension 1*1*1,
  - Number of cubes with 0 side painted= (n-2) ^3
  - Number of cubes with 1 sides painted =6(n - 2) ^2
  - Number of cubes with 2 sides painted= 12(n-2)
  - Number of cubes with 3 sidess painted= 8(always)
- For a cuboid of dimension a*b*c painted on all sides which is cut into smaller cubes of dimension 1*1*1,
  - Number of cubes with 0 side painted= (a-2) (b-2) (c-2)
  - Number of cubes with 1 sides painted =2 [(a-2) (b-2) + (b-2)(c-2) + (a-2)(c-2) ]
  - Number of cubes with 2 sides painted= 4(a+b+c -6)
  - Number of cubes with 3 sidess painted= 8
