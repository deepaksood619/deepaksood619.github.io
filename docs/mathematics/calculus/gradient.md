# Gradient

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), the **gradient** is a multi-variable generalization of the [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative). While a derivative can be defined on functions of a single variable, for [functions of several variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_of_several_variables), the gradient takes its place. The gradient is a [vector-valued function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector-valued_function), as opposed to a derivative, which is [scalar-valued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar-valued_function).

Like the derivative, the gradient represents the [slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope) of the [tangent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent) of the [graph of the function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function). More precisely, the gradient points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of the function, and its [magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(mathematics)) is the slope of the graph in that direction. The components of the gradient in coordinates are the coefficients of the variables in the equation of the [tangent space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space) to the graph. This characterising property of the gradient allows it to be defined independently of a choice of coordinate system, as a [vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field) whose components in a coordinate system will transform when going from one coordinate system to another.
