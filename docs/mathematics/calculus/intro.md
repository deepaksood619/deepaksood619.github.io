# Intro

The word Calculus comes from Latin meaning "small stone", Because it is like understanding something by looking at small pieces.
Differential Calculuscuts something into small pieces to find how it changes.

Integral Calculusjoins (integrates) the small pieces together to find how much there is.

## Limits

Limits are all about approaching. Sometimes you can't work something out directly, but you can see what it should be as you get closer and closer!

## Derivatives (Differential Calculus)

The Derivative is the "rate of change" or slope of a function at a point.

Intuition - How steep is a function/graph at a point.

## Integration (Integral Calculus)

Integration can be used to find areas, volumes, central points and many useful things.

Intuition - What is the area under the graph over a region

## Differential Equations

In our world things change, anddescribing how they changeoften ends up as a Differential Equation: an equation with afunctionand one or more of itsderivatives.

## Derivative Rules

- Product Rule
- Quotient Rule
- Chain Rule

## Integral Rules

- U-substitution
- Integration by parts
- Partial fraction decomposition

## Higher Dimensions

- Partial derivatives
- Double Integral

## Scalar Field - If a function has 3 inputs and 1 output

## Vector Field - If a function has 3 inputs and 1 vector output
