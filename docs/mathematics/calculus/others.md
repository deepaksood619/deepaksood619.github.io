## Laplace Transform

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), theLaplace transformis an [integral transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_transform) named after its inventor [Pierre-Simon Laplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace)([/ləˈplɑːs/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English)). It transforms a function of a real variablet(often time) to a function of a [complex variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis) s([complex frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_frequency)). The transform has many applications in science and engineering.
The Laplace transform is similar to the [Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform). While the Fourier transform of a function is a [complex function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_function) of arealvariable (frequency), the Laplace transform of a function is a complex function of acomplex variable. Laplace transforms are usually restricted to functions oftwitht≥ 0. A consequence of this restriction is that the Laplace transform of a function is a [holomorphic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holomorphic_function) of the variables. Unlike the Fourier transform, the Laplace transform of a [distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)) is generally a [well-behaved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-behaved) function. Techniques of complex variables can also be used to directly study Laplace transforms. As a holomorphic function, the Laplace transform has a power series representation. This power series expresses a function as a linear superposition of [moments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_(mathematics)) of the function. This perspective has applications in [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory).
The Laplace transform is invertible on a large class of functions. The inverse Laplace transform takes a function of a complex variables(often frequency) and yields a function of a real variablet(often time). Given a simple mathematical or functional description of an input or output to a [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System), the Laplace transform provides an alternative functional description that often simplifies the process of analyzing the behavior of the system, or in synthesizing a new system based on a set of specifications. So, for example, Laplace transformation from the [time domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_domain) to the [frequency domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_domain) transforms differential equations into algebraic equations and [convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution) into multiplication.
