# Intro

## Combinatoricsis an area of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) primarily concerned with counting, both as a means and an end in obtaining results, and certain properties of [finite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_set)[structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_structure). It is closely related to many other areas of mathematics and has many applications ranging from [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic) to [statistical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_physics), from [evolutionary biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_biology) to [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), etc

## Twelve-fold way

In [combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics), thetwelvefold wayis a systematic classification of 12 related enumerative problems concerning two finite sets, which include the classical problems of [counting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting) [permutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutations), [combinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinations), [multisets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset), and partitions either [of a set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_a_set) or [of a number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory)). The idea of the classification is credited to [Gian-Carlo Rota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gian-Carlo_Rota), and the name was suggested by [Joel Spencer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Spencer).
