## Norm

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), anormis a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)) from a real or complex [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space) to the nonnegative real numbers that behaves in certain ways like the distance from the [origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_(mathematics)): it [commutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivariant_map) with scaling, obeys a form of the [triangle inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_inequality), and is zero only at the origin. In particular, the [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) of a vector from the origin is a norm, called the [Euclidean norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Euclidean_norm), or [2-norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#p-norm), which may also be defined as the square root of the [inner product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product) of a vector with itself.

A pseudo norm or seminorm satisfies the first two properties of a norm, but may be zero for other vectors than the origin.A vector space with a specified norm is called a [normed vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normed_vector_space). In a similar manner, a vector space with a seminorm is called aseminormed vector space.

## Vector Norm

Calculating the size or length of a vector is often required either directly or as part of a broader vector or vector-matrix operation.

The length of the vector is referred to as the vector norm or the vector's magnitude.

The length of a vector is a nonnegative number that describes the extent of the vector in space, and is sometimes referred to as the vector's magnitude or the norm.- The L1 norm that is calculated as the sum of the absolute values of the vector.

- The L2 norm that is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared vector values.
- The max norm that is calculated as the maximum vector values.
