# Intro

Statistics is a subfield of mathematics. It refers to a collection of methods for working with data and using data to answer questions.

## Statistics drives practice, policy and laws

- In almost every aspect of our lives, practice and policy is determined by statistics
  - In fiscal policy, governments decide taxation and spending, based upon statistical assessments of their effects on the economy
  - In health care, questions of what drugs should be approved and what treatment patients should get is based upon statistics (often in medical research)
  - In our personal lives, our choices of where to work, live and how to save/invest are at least loosely driven by statistics
- Making good policy and personal decisions requires an understanding of statistics and data. If we misread the statistics or the statistics are unreliable, policy will as well

## Lying with Statistics

- **Agendra-driven data:** As access to data has increased, the misuse of that data has also gone up, especially when people have agendas and want to further them. These people mislead, without technically lying, as the selectively pick and choose which data they use, and how they present that data
- **Social media as magnifier:** Bad data can take on a life of its won, especially with social media operating as a weapon to widen its reach
  - Gresham's Law
    - A monetary principle stating that "bad money drives out good". It is primarily used for consideration and application in currency markets. Gresham's law was originally based on the composition of minted coins and the value of the precious metals used in them.
- **Caveat emptor:** As people weaponize data and use selective and slanted statistics, based upon that data, we need to be able to protect ourselves from misinformation
  - Understanding statistics allows us to
    - Look for red flags that can be used to detect data manipulation
    - Asking the right questions to separate fact from fiction

## Mathematical Thinking

Mathematical thinking is about seeing the world in a different way. Which means sometimes seeing beyond our intuition or gut feeling

## Population

- Collection of all items of interest of our study
- Denoted by **N**
- Numbers obtained are called parameters

## Sample

- A subset of the population
- Denoted by **n**
- Numbers obtained are called statistics

## Time Series vs Cross Section

The data that you are trying to study can be a phenomenon that you observe over time (time series data) or across different subjects at a point in time (cross sectional data)

- Time series example: If stock returns over time is your population, stock returns from 1960-2021 is a sample
- Cross sectional example: If all publicly traded companies is your population, looking at only US companies or companies with market caps that exceed $10 million is a sample

## Regression toward the mean

In [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics), regression toward the mean(also calledregression to the mean, reversion to the mean, andreversion to mediocrity) is the phenomenon that arises if a [sample point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_point) of a [random variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable) is [extreme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_value_theory) (nearly an [outlier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier)), a future point is likely to be closer to the [mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean) or [average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average).To avoid making incorrect [inferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference), regression toward the mean must be considered when designing scientific experiments and interpreting data.

## Controlled Experiments

- Randomness

- Allocation bias and Selection bias

- Randomized block design (where number of items in each group can be forced to be equal)

- Control groups

- Placebo effects - Placebo meaning - I shall please

- Single blind study

- Double blind study

- Matched-pair experiments

- Repeated measures design

## Henrietta Lacks, the Tuskegee Experiment, & Ethical Data Collection

- Informed Consent

- Nuremberg code

- Beneficence
