| Null hypothesis                 | The null hypothesis is the one to be tested. Whenever we are conducting a test, we are trying to reject the null hypothesis.                                                                                                                                   |
| Alternative hypothesis          | The alternative hypothesis is the opposite of the null. It is usually the opinion of the researcher, as he is trying to reject the null hypothesis and thus accept the alternative one.                                                                        |

| One-tailed (one-sided) test     | Tests which are determining if a value is lower (lower or equal) or higher (higher or equal) to a certain value are one-sided. This is because they can be rejected only on one side.                                                                          |
| Two-tailed (two-sided) test     | Tests which are determining if a value is equal (or different) to a certain value are two-sided. This is because they can be rejected on two sides - if the parameter is too big or too small.                                                                 |
