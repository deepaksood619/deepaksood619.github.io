## Hypotheses

- A hypothesis is "an idea that can be tested"
- It is a supposition or proposed explanation made on the basis of limited evidence as a starting point for further investigation

## Level of significance and types of tests

- Level of significance (Î±) - The probability of rejecting a null hypothesis that is true; the probability of making this error.

## P-value

- The p-value is the smallest level of significance at which we can still reject the null hypothesis, given the observed sample statistic
