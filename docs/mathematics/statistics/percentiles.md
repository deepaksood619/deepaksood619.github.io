# Percentiles

Tell you what percentage of the population has a score or value that's lower than yours.

Percentile is a statistical concept used to describe a specific position or value in a distribution of data. It indicates the relative position of a particular data point within the entire dataset, expressing what percentage of the values are equal to or below that point.

In simpler terms, a percentile represents the value below which a given percentage of the data falls. For example, if you are in the 80th percentile for height, it means that your height is greater than or equal to 80% of the heights in the dataset.

Percentiles are often denoted by a number ranging from 0 to 100. The 0th percentile represents the minimum value in the dataset, while the 100th percentile corresponds to the maximum value. The median, or 50th percentile, divides the data into two equal halves.

Percentiles are useful for comparing individual data points to the overall distribution and understanding their relative position within a dataset. They are commonly used in various fields, such as education, finance, healthcare, and sports, to analyze and interpret data.

## Percentile Rank

To determine where an individual's salary lies in comparison to all other salaries, you can use percentile rank analysis. Percentile rank is a statistical measure that indicates the percentage of values that are equal to or below a given value within a dataset.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use percentile rank analysis:

1. Collect the salary data: Gather a comprehensive dataset containing the salaries of all individuals you want to compare against. Ensure that the data is representative and covers a wide range of salaries.

2. Sort the data: Arrange the salary data in ascending order from lowest to highest. This step is crucial for percentile calculations.

3. Calculate the percentile rank: Determine the percentile rank of the individual's salary using the following formula:

    `Percentile rank = (Number of salaries below the individual's salary / Total number of salaries) x 100`

    For example, if there are 100 salaries in the dataset and the individual's salary is greater than 75 of them, the percentile rank would be (75 / 100) x 100 = 75%.

4. Interpret the percentile rank: The percentile rank indicates the percentage of salaries that are equal to or below the individual's salary. For instance, if the individual's percentile rank is 75%, it means that their salary is higher than approximately 75% of the salaries in the dataset.

By using percentile rank analysis, you can assess where an individual's salary stands relative to the entire dataset, providing a context of their salary position among their peers.

## Percentile vs Percentile Rank

1. **Percentile:** A percentile is a specific value or data point that divides a dataset into two parts. It represents the value below which a certain percentage of the data falls. For example, the 75th percentile is the value below which 75% of the data lies.
2. **Percentile Rank:** Percentile rank, on the other hand, is the relative position of a particular data point within a dataset expressed as a percentage. It indicates what percentage of values are equal to or below a specific data point. For example, if a student's test score is at the 80th percentile rank, it means their score is higher than or equal to 80% of the scores in the dataset.

In summary, a percentile is a specific value that divides a dataset, while a percentile rank represents the position or ranking of a particular data point within the dataset as a percentage. Percentile rank provides a way to compare individual data points to the entire dataset, while percentiles indicate the specific values that divide the data.

## Percentage vs Percentile

The key difference between percentage and percentile is the percentage is a mathematical value presented out of 100 and percentile is the per cent of values below a specific value. The percentage is a means ofÂ [comparing quantities](https://byjus.com/maths/percentage-comparing-quantities/). A percentile is used to display position or rank.
