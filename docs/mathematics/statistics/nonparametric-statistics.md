# Nonparametric Statistics

Nonparametric statisticsis the branch of [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics) that is not based solely on [parametrized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_parameter) families of [probability distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution)(common examples of parameters are the mean and variance). Nonparametric statistics is based on either being distribution-free or having a specified distribution but with the distribution's parameters unspecified. Nonparametric statistics includes both [descriptive statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics) and [statistical inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference).

## Non-parametric models

Non-parametric modelsdiffer from [parametric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_statistics) models in that the model structure is not specifieda prioribut is instead determined from data. The termnon-parametricis not meant to imply that such models completely lack parameters but that the number and nature of the parameters are flexible and not fixed in advance.

- A [histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram) is a simple nonparametric estimate of a probability distribution.
- **[Kernel density estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation)(KDE)** provides better estimates of the density than histograms.

In [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics), kernel density estimation(KDE) is a [non-parametric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-parametric_statistics) way to [estimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_estimation) the [probability density function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function) of a [random variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable). Kernel density estimation is a fundamental data smoothing problem where inferences about the [population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_population) are made, based on a finite data [sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_sample). In some fields such as [signal processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing) and [econometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics) it is also termed the **Parzen--Rosenblatt window** method, after [Emanuel Parzen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuel_Parzen) and [Murray Rosenblatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Rosenblatt), who are usually credited with independently creating it in its current form.One of the famous applications of kernel density estimation is in estimating the class-conditional marginal densities of data when using a [naive Bayes classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier), which can improve its prediction accuracy.- [Nonparametric regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonparametric_regression) and [semiparametric regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiparametric_regression) methods have been developed based on [kernels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(statistics)), [splines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_(mathematics)), and [wavelets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelet).

- [Data envelopment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_envelopment_analysis) provides efficiency coefficients similar to those obtained by [multivariate analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis) without any distributional assumption.
- [KNNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) classify the unseen instance based on the K points in the training set which are nearest to it.
- A [support vector machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine)(with a Gaussian kernel) is a nonparametric large-margin classifier.
- [Method of moments (statistics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_moments_(statistics)) with polynomial probability distributions.

## Methods

Non-parametric(ordistribution-free)inferential statistical methodsare mathematical procedures for statistical hypothesis testing which, unlike [parametric statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_statistics), make no assumptions about the [probability distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution) of the variables being assessed. The most frequently used tests include

- [Kruskal--Wallis one-way analysis of variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%E2%80%93Wallis_one-way_analysis_of_variance) by ranks: tests whether >2 independent samples are drawn from the same distribution
- [Kuiper's test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper%27s_test): tests whether a sample is drawn from a given distribution, sensitive to cyclic variations such as day of the week
