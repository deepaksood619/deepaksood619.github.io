# Ackermann Function

In [computability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability_theory), the**Ackermann function**, named after [Wilhelm Ackermann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Ackermann), is one of the simplest  and earliest-discovered examples of a [total](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_function)[computable function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computable_function) that is not [primitive recursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_recursive_function). All primitive recursive functions are total and computable, but the Ackermann function illustrates that not all total computable functions are primitive recursive.
This function has a value ackermann(n) < 5, for any value of *n* that can be written in this physical universe. So essentially it's a constant time operation
