# Godel's Incompleteness Theorem

Gödel's incompleteness theoremsare two [theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem) of [mathematical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic) that demonstrate the inherent limitations of every formal [axiomatic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system) containing basic [arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic). These results, published by [Kurt Gödel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del) in 1931, are important both in mathematical logic and in the [philosophy of mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics). The theorems are widely, but not universally, interpreted as showing that [Hilbert's program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_program) to find a complete and consistent set of [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom) for all [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) is impossible.

The first incompleteness theorem states that no [consistent system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency) of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an [effective procedure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_procedure)(i.e., an [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm)) is capable of proving all truths about the arithmetic of the [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number). For any such formal system, there will always be statements about the natural numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system. The second incompleteness theorem, an extension of the first, shows that the system cannot demonstrate its own consistency.

Employing a [diagonal argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument), Gödel's incompleteness theorems were the first of several closely related theorems on the limitations of formal systems. They were followed by [Tarski's undefinability theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski%27s_undefinability_theorem) on the formal undefinability of truth, [Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church)'s proof that Hilbert's [Entscheidungsproblem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entscheidungsproblem) is unsolvable, and [Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing)'s theorem that there is no algorithm to solve the [halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem).

## Entscheidungs problem

The Entscheidungs problem is a challenge posed by [David Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert) and [Wilhelm Ackermann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Ackermann) in 1928.The problem asks for an [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) that takes as input a statement of a [first-order logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic) (possibly with a finite number of [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom) beyond the usual axioms of first-order logic) and answers "Yes" or "No" according to whether the statement isuniversally valid, i.e., valid in every [structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_(mathematical_logic)) satisfying the axioms. By [the completeness theorem of first-order logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_completeness_theorem), a statement is universally valid if and only if it can be deduced from the axioms, so the Entscheidungsproblem can also be viewed as asking for an algorithm to decide whether a given statement is provable from the axioms using the [rules of logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_logic).

In 1936, [Alonzo Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church) and [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) published independent papersshowing that a general solution to theEntscheidungsproblemis impossible, assuming that the intuitive notion of "[effectively calculable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effectively_calculable)" is captured by the functions computable by a [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine)(or equivalently, by those expressible in the [lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus)). This assumption is now known as the [Church--Turing thesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis).
