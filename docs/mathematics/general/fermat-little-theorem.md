# Fermat's Little Theorem

Fermat's little theoremis a fundamental theorem in elementary number theory, which helps compute powers of integers [modulo](https://brilliant.org/wiki/modular-arithmetic/)[prime numbers](https://brilliant.org/wiki/prime-numbers/). It is a special case of [Euler's theorem](https://brilliant.org/wiki/eulers-theorem/), and is important in applications of elementary number theory, including [primality testing](https://brilliant.org/wiki/prime-testing/) and [public-key cryptography](https://brilliant.org/wiki/rsa-encryption/).
Let p be a prime number, and a be any integer. Then a^p^ - a is always divisible by p.
