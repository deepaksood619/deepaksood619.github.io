# Fermat's Last Theorem

In [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory), **Fermat's Last Theorem**(sometimes called**Fermat's conjecture**, especially in older texts) states that no three [positive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_number)[integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer) *a*, *b*, and *c* satisfy the equation *a^n^*+*b^n^*=*c^n^* for any integer value of *n* greater than 2. The cases *n* = 1 and *n* = 2 have been known to have infinitely many solutions since antiquity.
