# RDBMS

A relational databaseis a database that organizes information into one or more tables. Here, the relational database contains one table.

A table is a collection of data organized into rows and columns. Tables are sometimes referred to as relations. Here the table is celebs.

A column is a set of data values of a particular type. Here, id, name, andageare the columns.

A row is a single record in a table.

All data stored in a relational database is of a certain data type. Some of the most common data types are:

- INTEGER, a positive or negative whole number
- TEXT, a text string
- DATE, the date formatted as YYYY-MM-DD
- REAL, a decimal value

## Codd's 12 rules

Codd's twelve rules are a set of thirteen rules ([numbered zero to twelve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering)) proposed by [Edgar F. Codd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_F._Codd), a pioneer of the [relational model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model) for [databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database), designed to define what is required from a [database management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_management_system) in order for it to be considered relational, i.e., a [relational database management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system)(RDBMS). They are sometimes jokingly referred to as Codd's Twelve Commandments.

- Rule 0: The foundation rule
- Rule 1: The information rule
- Rule 2: The guaranteed access rule
- Rule 3: Systematic treatment of null values
- Rule 4: Dynamic online catalog based on the relational model
- Rule 5: The comprehensive data sublanguage rule
- Rule 6: The view updating rule
- Rule 7: Possible for high-level insert, update, and delete
- Rule 8: Physical data independence
- Rule 9: Logical data independence
- Rule 10: Integrity independence
- Rule 11: Distribution independence
- Rule 12: The nonsubversion rule
