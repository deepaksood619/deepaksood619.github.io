### Thoughts

- Reading and writing is not required
	- [Will AI Make Us the Last Generation to Read and Write? \| Victor Riparbelli \| TED - YouTube](https://youtu.be/6wCml0g2mRE)
- And rote learning is not required
- AI will be question and answer with voice, and all facts will be accessible all the time

Use gemini or gpt live to learn about some topic

Create a tutoring system, that teaches naturally, and ask questions, create conversation, don't create a monologue.

Teach the best conversation techniques to gpt so it tries good conversation with the child and try to create a curiosity.

Feedback from camera from a child expression is very important, so gpt understand how child is expressing through his gestures and facial expressions. And tweak the delivery of education based on that.

Next big revolution is from text based gpt to voice, and then from voice based gpt to video, over both ways.

Audio visual communication.

### ChatGPT Feedback

- Same questions asked multiple times
- Skipped answer that I gave answered old
- Phone got hot
- Revision not effective
- Cannot remember what I answered and not answered
- 10 mins of free advanced voice model
- Learning is not that effective with only voice models, for deep learning, reading text generally offers better comprehension and retention of information compared to listening or watching. (Is it because I have learned as a kid this way or it's inherent for humans)

### Tech

- For a new technology
	- Can have a pre-populated database of questions and answers
