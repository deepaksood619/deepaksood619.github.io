- [linkedin.com/in/maheshwer-peri-1723ba3b/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maheshwer-peri-1723ba3b/)
- former president and publisher of the Outlook group
- I am a dreamer. I dream of an equal world. A fair world. A world where every one has equal opportunities and a fair shot at fame. A world that is rational, questioning and has heaps of scientific temper co-existing with trust and faith. I want to create an enterprise that impacts, influences and transforms careers and lives.
- I also believe that in a country like India, the only tool of empowerment is education. Good education can make billionaires out of paupers and bad education can do the opposite. If India has to claim its demographic dividend, we need to invest in our children, our youth through education. A misguided young population can quickly turn into a nightmare. I hope that I will be that spark that keeps fighting in small bits for India to be where it deserves. Dr. Man Mohan Singh and Dr.Kalam are my heroes – from how they were best students to become great leaders.
- My ability is limited. My reach is limited. My influence is limited too. But the power of my dreams is powerful. And so, I created a platform, Careers360.com, where 400 million sessions happen every year; 60 million students and parents visit each year. 5 million students register and use our tools and products every year.
- I am not a magician. I am a believer – in goodness, impact and change. I will fall. I will fail. But I will get up.
- Because I believe in my idea and the change it can bring. If you are a believer to, feel free to join forces!

	- Peri is also something of a puritan. He is vegetarian, does not drink or smoke and avoids social occasions. His abstemious nature is a subject of bemusement among his friends.
	- I will be the one to bell the cat. I am belling the cat

The problem is how to add human intelligence to our LLM model like if you are bad at history and that is only 10% of the whole 100% marks in UPSC then LLM should decide that it should focus more on the remaining 90% rather than the 10% which you are not able to crack.

First LLM should be trained on whole UPSC syllabus and should know everything about UPSC. It should have like 1 crore column and then for each candidate one row and it should know for each candidate what he/she knows.

This whole 1 crore features now should be sent to the LLM to decide on the next plan of action. as to what should be taught today to the candidate so that he can reach the ultimate goal. Foundational things should be taught first.

It should also get when you want to give the exam. And create a plan according to that along with probability of cracking the exam displayed each day.

It should make sure you learn 8 or whatever allocated hours for that day, based on your plan.

First judge the LLM what is its current capability for cracking UPSC exam.
