### DEXTools

**This is an all-in-one tool for new crypto tokens.**¬†It tracks real-time prices, transactions, liquidity, charts, and more.

**What‚Äôs cool about it:**¬†I don't know how to read a smart contract perfectly (your boy was only blessed with a double-digit IQ), but Dextools helps out by giving insights into:

- whether or not that specific token has a verified contract
- whether it‚Äôs safe or a scam
- the latest transactions for that token

### TokenSniffer

This is a tool that analyzes the token‚Äôs smart contract, tokenomics, holders, etc, and then¬†**generates a security audit score for that specific token.**

**What‚Äôs cool about it:**¬†TokenSniffer tells you stuff like if...

- The token is sellable or just a honeypot scam
- The contract source is verified
- The creator wallet holds more than 5% of the circulating token supply
- There‚Äôs adequate liquidity for the token
