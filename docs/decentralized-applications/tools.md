## Hyperledger

Hyperledger is an open source community focused on developing a suite of stable frameworks, tools and libraries for enterprise-grade blockchain deployments.

It serves as a neutral home for various distributed ledger frameworks including Hyperledger Fabric, Sawtooth, Indy, as well as tools like Hyperledger Caliper and libraries like Hyperledger Ursa.

### Hyperledger Fabric

**Type: Distributed ledger software**

Hyperledger Fabric is intended as a foundation for developing applications or solutions with a modular architecture. Hyperledger Fabric allows components, such as consensus and membership services, to be plug-and-play. Its modular and versatile design satisfies a broad range of industry use cases. It offers a unique approach to consensus that enables performance at scale while preserving privacy.

Below are some of the key features of Hyperledger Fabric and what differentiates it from other distributed ledger technologies

- Permissioned architecture
- Highly modular
- Pluggable consensus
- Open smart contract model - flexibility to implement any desired solution model (account model, UTXO model, structured data, unstructured data, etc)
- Low latency of finality/confirmation
- Flexible approach to data privacy : data isolation using 'channels', or share private data on a need-to-know basis using private data 'collections'
- Multi-language smart contract support: Go, Java, Javascript
- Support for EVM and Solidity
- Designed for continuous operations, including rolling upgrades and asymmetric version sup-port
- Governance and versioning of smart contracts
- Flexible endorsement model for achieving consensus across required organizations
- Queryable data (key-based queries and JSON queries)
