### Cake DeFi CEO briefing, 2nd week of 2023

1. The calm week 53 in 2022 and week 1 in 2023 played out as expected. For this week, I am expecting the pent-up demand to buy and/or sell cryptos or equities to happen this week‚Ä¶ So, get ready for lots of volatility in the upcoming days. IMPORTANT: This is NOT a new up- or down-trend. It is just the supply and demand of the past 2-3 weeks.

2. The key things in crypto to watch is the DCG/Genesis/Gemini story‚Ä¶ Let me know if you want me to explain this in greater detail, but you can read up on it here: <https://twitter.com/julianhosp/status/1609953125254709251> The short version is: Did DCG do the same embezzlement with Genesis, as FTX did with Alameda?! If it turns out as yes, we may see struggle in crypto. Otherwise I am not too bearish.

3. In the macro economy we have US CPI numbers on Thursday. I am expecting inflation to get lower than the general market expects. This will be bullish in the mid-term.

4. In the general markets, banks are starting to report Q4 2022 earnings this week. Get ready for a roller coaster!!

### The Fall of Terra: A Timeline of the Meteoric Rise and Crash of UST and LUNA

The Terra network and its leader, Do Kwon, rose to the highest tier of the crypto world thanks to big-shot investors, only to fall apart within a few days in May 2022.

On May 7, the price of the then-$18-billion algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST), which is supposed to maintain a $1 peg, started to wobble and fell to 35 cents on May 9. Its companion token, LUNA, which was meant to stabilize UST's price, fell from $80 to a few cents by May 12.

**FTX:** The collapse of FTX, the world‚Äôs second largest crypto exchange, shocked the world in November. Founder Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas and extradited to the US after a long delay, during which he went on an ill-advised media tour. Earlier this month he pleaded not guilty to criminal charges.

**Genesis:** One of the world‚Äôs largest crypto lenders, Genesis froze withdrawals in November after the spectacular collapse of FTX.

**BlockFi:** The crypto lender filed for bankruptcy in late November, a fortnight after FTX collapsed, as it had substantial exposure to the crypto exchange. Another victim of the terraUSD collapse, It had been relying on a $400 million credit facility from FTX to stay solvent after Voyager and Celsius went bankrupt in July.
