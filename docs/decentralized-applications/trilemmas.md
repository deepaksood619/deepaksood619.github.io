The blockchain trilemma is a concept coined by [Vitalik Buterin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/vitalik-buterin) that proposes a set of three main issues - decentralization, security and scalability - that developers encounter when building blockchains, forcing them to ultimately sacrifice one "aspect" for as a trade-off to accommodate the other two

## Interoperability Trilemma

Interop protocols can only have two of the following three properties:

- **Extensibility:** able to be supported on any domain.
- **Generalizeability:** capable of handling arbitrary cross-domain data.
