# DeFi Decentralized Finance

## Decentralized Finance - DeFi

- Allow most operations traditional financial instruments, but on The Blockchain
  - Borrowing, Lending
  - Price speculation
  - Swapping once ERC-20 token for another
    - F.e. Uniswap

## Concepts

- DeFi is eating Finance
  - Operating Costs
    - Deutsche Bank: $10B/yr general & administrative expenses
    - Lending Club: $325M product, generall & administrative expenses
  - Volume & Capital Efficiency
    - Ethereum payments volume exceeds PayPal ($1.6T vs $0.9T) with 64 vs 26k employees
  - Ecosystem Transparency
- **Native Decentralized Finance** or NativeDeFi means that the DeFi applications on DeFiChain are built directly on the blockchain, ensuring the highest level of security standards and a greater resistance to hacks.

### NativeDeFi vs. DeFi on Ethereum

- Most DeFi projects are built on the **Ethereum** blockchain, where applications run on so-called virtual machines. **Unlike native blockchains**, blockchains like Ethereum offer **greater flexibility** for developers. This flexibility, however, **makes them more risky for decentralized financial applications.**
- When it comes to financial services, Ethereum uses smart contracts on the **application layer**, which could be prone to **human errors and coding mistakes**. In addition, they are simply **not built for the function of financial applications**, but rather a one-size-fits all solution. There, the code gets compiled and has to run through a virtual machine.
- On blockchains like DeFiChain, the **execution** of the code happens **directly on the native blockchain** layer - no “on-top” application layer is needed. As a result, DeFiChain is perfectly designed for all kinds of financial applications and services.
- Performing DeFi transactions on Ethereum takes more than 3,000 distinct steps - each with its own **potential attack** surface. On DeFiChain, just a few lines of code are enough, making transactions much more robust against potential attacks, and DeFiChain’s NativeDeFi approach, more secure.
- The main benefits of NativeDeFi include: **Consensus happens directly on the native blockchain layer**, the **transaction costs are low**, and the attack surface is low.
