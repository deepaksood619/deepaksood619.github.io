- Ethereum is the only major protocol building a scalable unified settlement and data availability layer
- Rollups scale computation while leveraging Ethereum’s security
- All roads lead to the endgame of centralized block production, decentralized trustless block validation, and censorship resistance
- Innovations such as proposer-builder separation (PBS) and weak statelessness unlock this separation of powers (building and validating) to achieve scalability without sacrificing security or decentralization

  - [State of research: increasing censorship resistance of transactions under proposer/builder separation (PBS) - HackMD](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/pbs_censorship_resistance)
- MEV is now front and center – numerous designs are planned to mitigate its harm and prevent its centralizing tendencies
- Danksharding combines multiple avenues of cutting edge research to provide the scalable base layer required for Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap
- I do expect danksharding to be implemented within our lifetimes

## [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/)

The Graph is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum and IPFS. Anyone can build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, making data easily accessible.

## Ethereum Name Service (ENS)

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain.

ENS’s job is to map human-readable names like ‘alice.eth’ to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses, other cryptocurrency addresses, content hashes, and metadata. ENS also supports ‘reverse resolution’, making it possible to associate metadata such as canonical names or interface descriptions with Ethereum addresses.

### Types of DIDs (Decentralized Identities)

- **Non-custodial crypto wallets**: You have full control over your private keys, which are used to verify transactions and prove ownership of a blockchain address.
- **Unstoppable Domains**: It lets you buy and mint Web3 domain names that are yours to keep forever.
- **Soulbound tokens (SBTs)**: The SBTs are basically non-transferrable NFTs that represent your digital persona in Web3.
- **Ethereum Name Service (ENS)**: It allows you to create ".eth" domains that replace your public wallet address. With ENS, decentralized identifiers are recorded on public and immutable ledgers like Ethereum in the form of a smart contract address.
