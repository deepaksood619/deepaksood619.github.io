## [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Ethereum - Delphi Digital](https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-ethereum)

- Ethereum is the only major protocol building a scalable unified settlement and data availability layer
- Rollups scale computation while leveraging Ethereum’s security
- All roads lead to the endgame of centralized block production, decentralized trustless block validation, and censorship resistance
- Innovations such as proposer-builder separation and weak statelessness unlock this separation of powers (building and validating) to achieve scalability without sacrificing security or decentralization
- MEV is now front and center – numerous designs are planned to mitigate its harm and prevent its centralizing tendencies
- Danksharding combines multiple avenues of cutting edge research to provide the scalable base layer required for Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap
- I do expect danksharding to be implemented within our lifetimes

## [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/)

The Graph is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum and IPFS. Anyone can build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, making data easily accessible.
