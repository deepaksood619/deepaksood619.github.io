# Layer 2 Protocols

In the context of blockchain, a "layer 2" refers to a secondary protocol or technology built on top of a primary blockchain, which provides additional functionality or scalability solutions while relying on the security of the underlying blockchain.

In the case of Ethereum, there are several layer 2 solutions being developed to address the network's current limitations in terms of scalability and transaction throughput. These layer 2 solutions include:

1. **State channels:** Off-chain agreements between parties that allow for multiple transactions to be conducted without touching the main blockchain until they are settled.
2. **Plasma:** A framework for creating a hierarchy of blockchains (or "child chains") that can process transactions off-chain and periodically commit them to the main Ethereum blockchain.
3. **Sidechains:** Independent blockchains that are interoperable with the Ethereum mainnet, allowing for off-chain transactions and reducing congestion on the main network.
4. **Rollups:** An approach that allows for the aggregation of multiple transactions into a single transaction on the main Ethereum blockchain, significantly increasing the network's capacity to process transactions.

These layer 2 solutions are intended to improve the efficiency and speed of transactions on the Ethereum network, while maintaining the security and decentralization of the underlying blockchain. Other blockchains, such as Bitcoin, also have their own layer 2 solutions, which include technologies like Lightning Network and Liquid Network.

There is currently no one-size-fits-all solution to scaling blockchain networks, and different layer 2 solutions are being developed to address different use cases and requirements.

That being said, **rollups** are currently one of the most promising layer 2 solutions being developed for Ethereum, as they offer significant scalability improvements while maintaining the network's security and decentralization. Rollups work by aggregating multiple transactions into a single transaction on the main Ethereum blockchain, reducing the burden on the network while maintaining the security guarantees of the underlying blockchain.

Several rollup solutions are already live or in the process of being implemented on Ethereum, including **Optimistic Rollups, ZK-Rollups, and Validium**. These solutions have the potential to significantly increase the network's capacity to process transactions, thereby unlocking new use cases for decentralized applications and reducing the cost of using the Ethereum network.

 Optimism is a fast, stable, and scalable L2 blockchain built by Ethereum developers, for Ethereum developers. Built as a minimal extension to existing Ethereum software, Optimism‚Äôs EVM-equivalent architecture scales your Ethereum apps without surprises. If it works on Ethereum, it works on Optimism at a fraction of the cost.

## ZK Proof (Zero Knowledge Proof)

A cryptographic method for proving a statement is true without revealing any information about the statement ‚Äì other than that it is true.

The acronym **zk-SNARK stands for ‚ÄúZero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge,‚Äù** and refers to a proof construction where one can prove possession of certain information, e.g. a secret key, without revealing that information, and without any interaction between the prover and verifier. In May 2022, Zcash began the process of upgrading its underlying cryptography and moving to a new proof composition called Halo.

‚ÄúZero-knowledge‚Äù proofs allow one party (the prover) to prove to another (the verifier) that a statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. For example, given the hash of a random number, the prover could convince the verifier that there indeed exists a number with this hash value, without revealing what it is.
