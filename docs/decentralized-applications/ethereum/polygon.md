# Polygon

Polygon, previously known as Matic Network, is a layer-2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to improve the scalability and performance of the Ethereum network by providing faster and cheaper transactions through its own infrastructure.

Polygon uses a unique architecture that is based on a combination of sidechains and plasma chains, which are connected to the Ethereum mainchain. This allows for a high degree of compatibility with Ethereum, and enables the seamless transfer of assets between the two networks.

The Polygon network provides several key features that make it attractive to developers and users of decentralized applications (dApps). These features include:

1. **High scalability:** Polygon can process thousands of transactions per second, which is significantly higher than the transaction capacity of the Ethereum mainchain.
2. **Low transaction fees:** Transactions on Polygon are much cheaper than on the Ethereum mainchain, due to the reduced load on the mainchain.
3. **Interoperability:** Polygon is designed to be compatible with other blockchains and layer-2 solutions, which can facilitate the creation of cross-chain applications and enable greater interoperability between different networks.
4. **Developer-friendly:** Polygon provides a range of developer tools and resources, including smart contract templates, software development kits (SDKs), and developer documentation, to help developers build and deploy dApps on the network.

Overall, Polygon aims to provide a scalable and efficient infrastructure for decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain, and has become a popular choice for developers and users who require fast and affordable transactions.
