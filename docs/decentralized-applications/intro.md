# Intro

1. Centralized
2. Decentralised
3. Distributed

## 2.0 stack

- AWS S3 for storage
- Aws EC2 for compute
- Stripe for payments
- Third party services for other services

## Web 3.0 stack (dApps)

- Etherium, truebit (scalable computation)
- IPFS (inter planetary file system) / FileCoin (storage)
- Oracles (External data)
- Token Model (Monetization)
- Bitcoin (payments)

## Features of decentralised application

- Open source
- Use of cryptocurrency
  - Allocate a scarce resource to monetize.
  - Example - Steemit
- Decentralised consensus
  - Ability of a network to agree about on something
  - Proof of work algorithm
  - 51% of all the nodes must approve the work
  - Big files are stored in a distributed hash table (DHT) (IPFS)
  - Block chain helps the DHT reach consensus
  - Smart contracts which are crypoeconomically secured code
  - Etherium has a tiring complete block chain
- No central point of failure (IPFS Stack)
  - Instead of IP addressing our content, we should content address it
  - Merkle DAG
  - Resiliency happening with bits and shards of data replicated across network (multiple nodes)

## Difference between Blockchain, Ethereum and Bitcoin

Blockchain, Ethereum, and Bitcoin are related technologies, but they are not the same thing. Here's a brief explanation of each:

Blockchain: A blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across many computers in a secure and transparent manner. Each block in a blockchain contains a set of transactions, and once a block is added to the chain, its information cannot be altered or deleted. This makes blockchains an ideal platform for secure and transparent record-keeping, as well as for applications that require decentralized trust and collaboration.

Bitcoin: Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that was created in 2009. It is based on a blockchain and is designed to allow secure and anonymous peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a central authority. Bitcoin is used as a form of digital money and has become the most well-known application of blockchain technology.

Ethereum: Ethereum is a blockchain-based platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts. Unlike Bitcoin, which is primarily used as a currency, Ethereum is a platform for developers to build decentralized applications. It has its own cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), which is used to pay for transactions and computational services on the network.

In summary, **Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency built on a blockchain, while Ethereum is a blockchain-based platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts.** The difference between them lies in their primary use cases: Bitcoin is primarily used as a digital currency, while Ethereum is a platform for building decentralized applications.
