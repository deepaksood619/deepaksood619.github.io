# Blockchain

Inventor - Satoshi Nakamoto

"Most technologies tend to automate workers on the periphery who are doing menial tasks. But blockchains automate away the center. Instead of putting taxi drivers out of a job, blockchain puts Uber out of a job, and lets the taxi drivers work with the customer directly." --- Vitalik Buterin, Creator of Ethereum

A blockchain is a data structure that enables identifying and tracking transactions digitally and sharing this information across a distributed network of computers, creating a distributed trust network.

A blockchain is a **shared public ledger that exists and is digitally distributed across a network.**

Blockchain is to the money what email was to the letter.

The more participants you actually have in the decentralized network, the more stable the entire cryptocurrency is going to be.

## What problem does blockchain solves

- Creating / updating / deleting anything in physical word requires money, but in digital world it's free
- How can we make sure that information that is digital can be trusted, so it doesn't get altered
- So in current system we have centralized institutions that create data, store data, update/delete data, and we have to trust them
- Instead of two parties having contract, every participant has a copy of that contract and transactions
- But only the people who created that data, can alter that data with their private key, but everyone sees that who and what has been edited

## Featues of Blockchain

- **Distributed / Decentralized -** Data is replicated on all the nodes in a distributed P2P network, and each copy of the ledger is identical to others. It can also be decentralised with some lighter nodes not having full data storage with limited connection.
- **Consensus mechanism -** All users in the network can come to a pre-determined programmable agreement on the method of validation and can be by consensus.
- **Irreversibility and crypto security -** One would need to command at least 51% of the computing power (or nodes or stake) to take control of the bitcoin blockchain.
- **Cryptographically secure -** That means that the minting of digital currency is secured by mathematical algorithms that make it very difficult to break. It prevents bad actors from creating fake transactions, erasing transactions, stealing funds, etc.
- **Finite-state machines -** In Computer Science, a state machine is a machine that will analyze a series of inputs and based on those inputs will transition to a new state. Blockchains have one instance responsible for all the transactions being created by the system. There's one global truth that all nodes adhere to, they all share the same state.

## Oracle problem

- Cryptography works only within the system
- Any interface to the real world requires trust in a node other than self
  - In which case no distributed consensus is required
- Cryptocurrencies have, more or less by definition, only one use case: **Ponzi schemes and other scams**
- A pure timestamping hash chain/Merkle tree (without consensus overhead) can be useful
