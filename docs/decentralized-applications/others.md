## IPFS (InterPlanatery File System)

InterPlanetary File System(IPFS) is a [protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol) and network designed to create a [content-addressable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage), [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) method of storing and sharing [hypermedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia) in a [distributed file system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_file_system)

IPFS is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. IPFS could be seen as a single [BitTorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) swarm, exchanging objects within one [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) repository. In other words, IPFS provides a high-throughput, content-addressed [block storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_storage) model, with content-addressed [hyperlinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink).Distributed Content Delivery saves bandwidth and prevents [DDoS attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack), which HTTP struggles with.

### Working

- Each file and all of the blocks within it are given a unique fingerprint called a cryptographic hash.
- IPFS removes duplications across the network.
- Each network nodestores only content it is interested in, and some indexing information that helps figure out who is storing what.
- When looking up files, you're asking the network to find nodes storing the content behind a unique hash.
- Every file can be found by human-readable names using a decentralized naming system called IPNS.

## OpenBazaar

OpenBazaar is an open source project developing a protocol for [e-commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce) transactions in a fully [decentralized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization) marketplace. It uses [cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) as medium of exchange and was inspired by a [hackathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) project called - DarkMarket

## XRootD

The XROOTD project aims at giving high performance, scalable fault tolerant access to data repositories of many kinds. The typical usage is to give access to file-based ones. It is based on a scalable architecture, a communication protocol, and a set of plugins and tools based on those. The freedom to configure it and to make it scale (for size and performance) allows the deployment of data access clusters of virtually any size, which can include sophisticated features, like authentication/authorization, integrations with other systems, WAN data distribution, etc.

XRootD software framework is a fully generic suite for fast, low latency and scalable data access, which can serve natively any kind of data, organized as a hierarchical filesystem-like namespace, based on the concept of directory. As a general rule, particular emphasis has been put in the quality of the core software parts.
