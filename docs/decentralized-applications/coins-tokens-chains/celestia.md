A scalable modular blockchain network built for data availability and consensus

The source of the blockchain trilemma is largely attributed to the [monolithic](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/modular-vs-monolithic-blockchains-what-s-the-difference) structures of the traditional blockchain. In most blockchains, all of the core functions of a blockchain: execution, [settlement](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/settlement-layer), [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus-mechanism) and [data availability](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-data-availability), are handled by a single chain. However, with a single chain handling all functions, this led to the emergence of bottlenecks when chain usage surged.

Modular blockchains proposed more efficient scaling via the separation of one or more functions of a blockchain into its own layer. These modular layers are customizable and specialized to the specific function assigned to them, creating a more robust and flexible system, as opposed to the traditional monolithic design.

The modular design has gained significant traction, especially with Ethereumâ€™s [rollups](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/optimistic-rollup), such as [Optimism](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/optimism-ethereum/) or [Arbitrum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/arbitrum/), which abstract the execution function to a separate layer, while Ethereum handles the rest.

But where does Celestia fit into all of this?

Celestia positions itself to handle the Data Availability and Consensus functions of the modular stack, enabling other projects and chains to build on top of its technology.
