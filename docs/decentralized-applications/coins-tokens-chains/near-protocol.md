## What Is NEAR Protocol (NEAR)?

[NEAR Protocol](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/near-protocol/)¬†is a¬†[layer-one blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-1-blockchain)¬†that was designed as a community-run cloud computing platform and that eliminates some of the limitations that have been bogging competing blockchains, such as low transaction speeds, low throughput and poor interoperability. This provides the ideal environment for¬†[DApps](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/de/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps)¬†and creates a developer and user-friendly platform. For instance, NEAR uses human-readable account names, unlike the cryptographic wallet addresses common to¬†[Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/). NEAR also introduces unique solutions to scaling problems and has its own¬†[consensus mechanism](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus-mechanism)¬†called ‚ÄúDoomslug.‚Äù

## What Makes NEAR Protocol (NEAR) Unique?

NEAR uses its Nightshade technology to improve transaction throughput massively. Nightshade is a variation of¬†[sharding](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/sharding), in which individual sets of validators process transactions in parallel across multiple sharded chains, improving the overall capacity of the blockchain. In contrast to ‚Äúregular‚Äù sharding, shards in Nightshade produce a fraction of the next block, called ‚Äúchunks.‚Äù In doing so, NEAR Protocol is able to achieve up to 100,000 transactions per second and achieve near-instant transaction finality thanks to a one-second block cadence while simultaneously keeping transaction fees at virtually zero.

NEAR Protocol also improves upon the convoluted onboarding process of other blockchains by having human-readable addresses and building decentralized applications with similar registration flow to what users have already experienced. Moreover, it provides developers with modular components, helping them start projects like token contracts or NFTs more quickly.
