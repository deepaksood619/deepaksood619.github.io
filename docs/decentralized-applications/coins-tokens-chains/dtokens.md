[What Are Decentralized Assets And How do They Work?](https://blog.defichain.com/what-are-decentralised-stock-tokens-and-how-do-they-work/)

**Decentralized Assets (or dTokens) on DeFiChain are an entirely new and revolutionary form of crypto investment.** These dTokens can be created (minted) by anyone on the DeFiChain blockchain, simply by first locking a minimum of 50% DFI (with the option to add more in BTC, USDT and USDC) into a vault.

**A dToken can then be minted and taken out in the form of a decentralized loan, which is collateralized by crypto.** The price when minting a dToken is set by pricing oracles as a point of reference (for example, a TSLA oracle price is used to create dTSLA). A dToken can then either **be held** as an investment, **traded** on the DeFiChain DEX, or used for **Liquidity Mining** on the DEX.

**A dToken’s price moves freely and independently of the oracle price, depending on supply and demand of a given dToken on the DeFiChain DEX.** In order to close a loan and get back the collateralized cryptocurrencies, the corresponding dToken has to be paid back with interest, all of which is visible when a user takes out a decentralized loan.

**A dToken can also be purchased directly on the DeFiChain DEX without having to take out a loan.** This is applicable for investors who want to invest in decentralized assets without the need for collateralization or dealing with loan interests.

**These dTokens are minted by users, and any decentralized asset’s inherent value mostly depends on the value that the collective attributes to it (through trading on the DEX).** The exchange of these dTokens are facilitated by blockchains and is thus just the logical next step towards an egalitarian financial system for all participants.
