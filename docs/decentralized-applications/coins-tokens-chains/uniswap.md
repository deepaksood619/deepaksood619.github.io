#### Uniswap v3

- Automated Market Makers (AMMs) - [What is an Automated Market Maker? (Liquidity Pool Algorithm) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PbZMudPP5E) - Constant Product AMM
- Liquidity Providers (LPs)

Uniswap v3 introduces:

- **Concentrated liquidity,** giving individual LPs granular control over what price ranges their capital is allocated to. Individual positions are aggregated together into a single pool, forming one combined curve for users to trade against
- **Multiple fee tiers** , allowing LPs to be appropriately compensated for taking on varying degrees of risk

These features make Uniswap v3 **the most flexible and efficient AMM ever designed**:

- LPs can provide liquidity with **up to 4000x capital efficiency** relative to Uniswap v2, earning **higher returns on their capital**
- Capital efficiency paves the way for low-slippage **trade execution that can surpass both centralized exchanges and stablecoin-focused AMMs**
- LPs can significantly **increase their exposure to preferred assets** and **reduce their downside risk**
- LPs can sell one asset for another by adding liquidity to a price range entirely above or below the market price, approximating **a fee-earning limit order that executes along a smooth curve**

Uniswap's **oracles are now far easier and cheaper to integrate**. V3 oracles are capable of providing time-weighted average prices (TWAPs) on demand for any period within the last ~9 days. This removes the need for integrators to checkpoint historical values.
