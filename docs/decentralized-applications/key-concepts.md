## Trapdoor function

A trapdoor function is a function that is easy to compute in one direction but difficult to compute in the opposite direction unless you have special information. Trapdoor functions are essential for public key encryption - that's why they are commonly used in blockchain development to represent the ideas of addresses and private keys.

## Chain Fork

Blocks in the ledger are included in such a way as to build the longest chain, i.e., the chain with the greatest cumulative difficulty. Forking is a situation where there are two candidate blocks competing to form the longest blockchain and two miners discover a solution to the proof-of-work problem within a short period of time from each other. The network is then divided, because some nodes get blocks from miner #1 and some from miner #2.

A fork usually gets resolved in one block, because the probability that this situation happens again gets extremely lower with the next blocks that arise, so soon there is a new longest chain that will be considered as main.

(Note: This type of fork is distinct from a hard fork, which is where some developers decide to create a backward-incompatible change to the blockchain protocol, resulting in two forever-distinct blockchains.)

## On-chain Analysis

On-chain metrics turn blockchain-based transaction data into actionable crypto market insights.

## Total Value Locked (TVL)

Тotal value locked represents the number of assets that are currently being staked in a specific protocol.

Total value locked is a metric that is used to measure the overall health of a DeFi protocol. 

There are three main factors that are taken into consideration when calculating and looking at a decentralized financial services' market cap TVL ratio: calculating the supply, the maximum supply as well as the current price.

In order to get the current market cap, you need to multiply the circulating supply by the current price. In order to get to the TVL ratio, you would need to take that market cap number and divide it by the TVL of the service.

One of the main use of the TVL ratio is to help determine if a DeFi asset is undervalued or overvalued. If it is under 1, it is undervalued in most cases.
