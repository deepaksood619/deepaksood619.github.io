## What Is a Dual-Token Economy/Model (Two-Token Economy)?

The **dual-**[**token**](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token) **economy,** also referred to as the **dual-token model or system,** is a term used for crypto projects that offer **two different types of tokens**. The main idea behind creating tokens is to **avoid compliance issues with regulators and divide the project's ecosystem into two tokens for better usability**.

Typically, one of the two tokens is used as [security](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/security) to **raise investment for the crypto project**. The token does this by strictly following the regulations outlined for conventional securities, like bonds or stocks. The other token is **used on the network to fulfill certain roles or activities.** These roles usually differ from one project to another.

The **U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission aspect is the main reason why crypto projects prefer to adopt a dual-token economy model.** So far, the SEC has not clearly classified crypto assets, unlike securities, stocks, or bonds which have a clear standing in the SEC framework.

However, the [Framework for “Investment Contract” Analysis of Digital Assets](https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/framework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets), has provided a way for blockchain projects to **register their tokens as a security and set certain conditions for them to work in compliance with the regulations**.

To be considered a security, the project has to make sure that **its tokens offer real-world utility and profit to its holders and the project is completely** [**decentralized**](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized). If all of these conditions are met, then the token is considered a security token by the SEC.

Another benefit of adopting the dual-token economy model is that it **offers more incentives to token holders and potential investors than other projects in the industry**. With two tokens, a crypto project can offer a better incentive structure, features, upgrades, and functionalities to the end-users.

A great example is [Axie Infinity](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-axie-infinity), an **NFT gaming project that offers two tokens, SLP and AXS**, both of which are offered as incentives to users for playing the game. In this case, the **_‘’Small Love Potion’’_** or SLP is a **utility token** with an **unlimited supply** that can be used by Axie Infinity players to perform in-game tasks like **paying a breeding fee for their Axies (game characters)** and purchasing Axies from the built-in marketplace. Meanwhile, AXS is an [**ERC-20**](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20) **governance token** for the Axie universe with a maximum supply of **27 million**. AXS provides value to the Axie Infinity ecosystem where players can **buy the token directly from crypto exchanges** and the holders of AXS tokens can take part in in-game governance activities and [stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking) their tokens on the platform to gain passive rewards.

Apart from Axie Infinity, there are many other projects that function on the dual-economy mechanism like **VeChainThor, MakerDAO, Anchor, and Filmio**.
