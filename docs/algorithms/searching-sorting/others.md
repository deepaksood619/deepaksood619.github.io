## Beating sorting lower bounds

There is an O(n*log(n)) sorting lower bound for comparison based sorts, however, in this talk we'll see a new model for computation, the word RAM model, and data structures based on this model, which solve the Predecessor Problem efficiently leading to O(n*sqrt(log(n))) and usage of bit tricks in manipulating numbers. The data structures that we'll primarily see include the van Embde Boas Trees (FOCS '75) and an introduction to Y-Fast Tries.
