# Automated Planning and Scheduling

Automated planning and scheduling, sometimes denoted as simply AI Planning,  is a branch of [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) that concerns the realization of [strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy) or action sequences, typically for execution by [intelligent agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent), [autonomous robots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_robot) and [unmanned vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle). Unlike classical [control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_system) and [classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification) problems, the solutions are complex and must be discovered and optimized in multidimensional space. Planning is also related to [decision theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory)

In known environments with available models, planning can be done offline. Solutions can be found and evaluated prior to execution. In dynamically unknown environments, the [strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy) often needs to be revised online. Models and policies must be adapted. Solutions usually resort to iterative [trial and error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_and_error) processes commonly seen in [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence). These include [dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming), [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) and [combinatorial optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization). Languages used to describe planning and scheduling are often called [action languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_language).
