# Move by nature

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Move_by_nature>

Used in Minimax algorithm where the second player can be Nature.

In [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory) a**move by nature**is a *decision* or *move* in an [extensive form game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensive_form_game) made by a player who has no strategic interests in the outcome. The effect is to add a player, 'Nature', whose practical role is to act as a [random number generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generator). For instance, if a game of [Poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker) requires a dealer to choose which cards a player is dealt, the dealer plays the role of the**Nature player.**
