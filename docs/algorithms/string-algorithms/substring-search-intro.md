# Substring Search Intro

Algorithms for searching for a substring in a piece of text. We begin with a brute-force algorithm, whose running time is quadratic in the worst case. Next, we consider the ingenious Knuth--Morris--Pratt algorithm whose running time is guaranteed to be linear in the worst case. Then, we introduce the Boyer--Moore algorithm, whose running time is sublinear on typical inputs. Finally, we consider the Rabin--Karp fingerprint algorithm, which uses hashing in a clever way to solve the substring search and related problems

## Goal - Find pattern of length M in a text of length N

## Applications

- Find and Replace
- Computer Forensics (Find key on disks)
- Identify patterns indicative of spam
- Screen scaping : Extract relevant data from web page
