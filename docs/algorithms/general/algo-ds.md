## Questions to asking when solving a coding interview questions

1. What is the data types of the inputs?

   - Can we assume the string is ASCII or Unicode?

2. Do we have to worry about load factors?

3. Do we have to validate inputs?

4. Can we assume this fits in memory?

5. Can we use additional data structures?
