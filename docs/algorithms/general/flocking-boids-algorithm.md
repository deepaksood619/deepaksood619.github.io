# Flocking Boids Algorithm

Boids: Three simple rules lead to complex emergent flocking behavior in birds:

- Collision avoidance: point away from k nearest boids
- Flock centering: point towards the center of mass of k nearest boids
- Velocity matching: update velocity to the average of k nearest boids
