# Government Terms

## Equitable Distribution

Fiscal policy is done by the government through spending. Monetary policy is done by the central bank through interest rates.

## DPG - Digital Public Goods (e.g. UPI (Unified Payments Interface), Aadhaar, DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer), ONDC (Open Network for Digital Commerce))

## ONDC - Open Network for Digital Commerce

## Bureaucracy

- A system of government in which most of the important decisions are taken by state officials rather than by elected representatives.
- Excessively complicated administrative procedure.

## RedTape

Excessive bureaucracy or adherence to official rules and formalities.

early 18th century: so named because of the red or pink tape used to bind official documents.

## Budgeted estimates (BE)

These are the budget allocations announced at the beginning of each financial year. They comprise of the estimated receipts and expenditure of the Government that the Finance Minister (FM) brings out in the Annual Budget every year in the Parliament.

## Revised Estimates (RE)

These are the mid-year estimates of projected amounts of receipts and expenditure until the end of the financial year taking into account the trends of the Government's income & expenses for the year.

## Revenue Receipts

All receipts of the Government that are routine & recurring in nature and that do not involve the sale of any asset are called revenue receipts. They include the following:

## Tax Revenue

As the name suggests, these are the net tax receipts of the Government. This head includes the proceeds of both direct taxes (Income Tax, Corporate Tax etc.) and indirect taxes (GST, customs duty etc.) after deducting the refunds paid.

## Non-Tax Revenue

This head includes interest payments (received on loans given by the Centre to states, railways and others) and dividends and profits received from Public Sector Enterprises. Some services provided by the Government like railways, police, medical services etc. also earn revenue for the Government.

## Capital Receipts

Capital receipts are generated when the Government liquidates an asset (disinvestment) or recovers loans given to states and the like. Also called non-debt capital receipts, they are non-recurring and non-routine in nature. For example, the Government announces a disinvestment target every year during the Budget in which it outlines the Public Sector Enterprises in which it intends to sell a stake and the estimated proceeds it hopes to generate from the exercise.

## Devolution to states

Based on a formula prescribed the Finance Commission (a constitutional body formed every five years), the Centre devolves a fixed percentage of its tax revenue to the states. The 14thFinance Commission recommended increasing the tax devolution of the divisible pool to states to 42% (from 32% earlier) for the years 2015 to 2020, the single largest increase ever recommended.

## Revenue Expenditure

Expenses like salaries, subsidies and interest payments on loans which are regular and recurring in nature form the revenue expenditure of the Government. A major contributor to this head is subsidies that Government provides in various sectors & products like fertilizers, LPG, food etc.

## Capital Expenditure

Expenditure made for acquiring and creating assets like land, buildings, equipment (including defence) etc. forms part of capital expenditure. It also includes the Government's investments and loans given that are expected to yield future income. If you observe closely, Government's capital expenditure as a percentage of total expenditure has been showing a downward trend which reflects the fact that the less productive revenue expenditure has been eating into the potential asset creation funds of the Government.

## Revenue Deficit

The excess of expenditure over receipts under the revenue head is called the revenue deficit. That this deficit exists reflects that the Government does not generate enough revenue receipts to pay for its revenue expenditure. In an ideal world, this should be a surplus or at least be zero.

## Fiscal Deficit

This is the term we most often hear in the media. It is simply the shortfall of the Government's total income against its total expenditure. It is usually financed through borrowing, either from the RBI or from the capital market by issuing instruments like treasury bills and bonds. Since the capital markets have limited funding available, excessive Government borrowing from the market not only weakens the financial health of the country but also crowds out the market for private-sector borrowing. In Budget 2019, the FM had proposed issuing overseas bonds to finance its fiscal deficit by tapping the global markets. That plan, however, had to be put on the backburner mostly because of the domestic slowdown and perceived forex risks with a weakening rupee.

## Primary Deficit

It is simply the Fiscal Deficit minus interest payments.

AE= advanced economy;EMDE= emerging market and developing economy, low income (LIC) and lower middle-income (LMIC), EMEA - Europe, Middle East and Africa

## Subvention - Subvention refers to a grant of money in aid or support, mostly by the government

Government asks financial institutions to provide loans to farmers at below market rates.

## DRT and NCLT

The Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) and the National Company Law Tribunal are the two adjudicating bodies which are looking into the matters of debt recovery and govern the Bankruptcy Code. The powers of the two Tribunal have been separated so that they do not overlap. The DRT will look into the cases of individual bankruptcy while the NCLT will look into matters of the insolvency of limited liability partnerships, companies, and corporates.

## FRDMA (Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003)

TheFiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003(FRBMA) is an [Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Parliament) of the [Parliament of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India) to institutionalize financial discipline, reduce India's fiscal deficit, improve macroeconomic management and the overall management of the public funds by moving towards a [balanced budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_budget) and strengthen fiscal [prudence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudence). The main purpose was to eliminate revenue deficit of the country (building revenue surplus thereafter) and bring down the [fiscal deficit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_deficit) to a manageable 3% of the GDP by March 2008. However, due to the [2007 international financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008), the deadlines for the implementation of the targets in the act was initially postponed and subsequently suspended in 2009. In 2011, given the process of ongoing recovery, [Economic Advisory Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Advisory_Council) publicly advised the [Government of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India) to reconsider reinstating the provisions of the FRBMA.[N. K. Singh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._K._Singh) is currently the Chairman of the review committee for Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003, under the [Ministry of Finance (India)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Finance_(India)), [Government of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India).

The main objectives of the act were:

1. to introduce transparent fiscal management systems in the country

2. to introduce a more equitable and manageable distribution of the country's debts over the years

3. to aim for fiscal stability for India in the long run

Additionally, the act was expected to give necessary flexibility to [Reserve Bank of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_India)(RBI) for managing inflation in India.

## Content

Since the act was primarily for the management of the governments' behaviour, it provided for certain documents to be tabled in the [parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India) annually with regards to the country's fiscal policy. This included the following along with the [Annual Financial Statement anddemands for grants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_budget_of_India):

1. a document titledMedium-term Fiscal Policy Statement-- This report was to present a three-year rolling target for thefiscal indicators with any assumptions, if applicable. This statement was to further include an assessment of sustainability with regards torevenue deficitand the use of capital receipts of the Government (including market borrowings) for generating productive assets.

2. a document titledFiscal Policy Strategy Statement-- This was a tactical report enumerating strategies and policies for the upcoming [Financial Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Year) including strategic fiscal priorities, taxation policies, key fiscal measures and an evaluation of how the proposed policies of the Central Government conform to the 'Fiscal Management Principles' of this act.

3. a document titledMacro-economic Framework Statement-- This report was to contain forecasts enumerating the growth prospects of the country. GDP growth, revenue balance, gross fiscal balance and external account balance of the balance of payments were some of the key indicators to be included in this report.

The Act further required the government to develop measures to promotefiscal transparency and reduce secrecyin the preparation of the Government financial documents including the Union Budget.

## Economic Advisory Council

Economic Advisory Councilto the [Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India)(PMEAC) is a non-constitutional, non-permanent and independent body constituted to give economic advice to the [Government of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India), specifically the Prime Minister.The council serves to highlight key economic issues facing the country to the government of India from a neutral viewpoint.It advises the Prime Minister on economic issues like [inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation), [microfinance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfinance), and industrial output.

## Functions

Terms of reference as defined by the PMEAC are as follows:

1. Analyzing any issue, economic or otherwise, referred to it by the Prime Minister and advising him thereon;

2. Addressing issues of macroeconomic importance and presenting views thereon to the Prime Minister. This could be either suo-moto or on a reference from the Prime Minister or anyone else:

3. Submitting periodic reports to the Prime Minister on macroeconomic developments and issues with implications for economic policy;

## OECD

TheOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development(OECD) is an [intergovernmental economic organisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_organization) with 36member countries, founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress and world trade. It is a forum of countries describing themselves as committed to [democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy) and the [market economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy), providing a platform to compare policy experiences, seek answers to common problems, identify good practices and coordinate domestic and international policies of its members. Most OECD members are [high-income economies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_income_economy) with a very high [Human Development Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index)(HDI) and are regarded as [developed countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country). As of 2017, the OECD member states collectively comprised 62.2% of [global nominal GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal))([US$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar) 49.6 trillion) and 42.8% of global GDP ([Int$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geary%E2%80%93Khamis_dollar) 54.2 trillion) at [purchasing power parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)).OECD is an official [United Nations observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_observers).

## Fiscal

relating to government revenue, especially taxes.

## Fiscal Policy

In [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics) and [political science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science), fiscal policyis the use of government [revenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_revenue) collection (mainly [taxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax)) and [expenditure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending)(spending) to influence the economy. Fiscal policy is often used to stabilize the economy over the course of the [business cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_cycle).

Changes in the level and composition of taxation and government spending can affect the following [macroeconomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomic) variables, amongst others:

- [Aggregate demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_demand) and the level of economic activity;
- [Saving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving) and [investment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_(macroeconomics));
- [Income distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_distribution).

Fiscal policy can be distinguished from [monetary policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy), in that fiscal policy deals with taxation and government spending and is often administered by an executive under laws of a legislature, whereas monetary policy deals with the money supply and interest rates and is often administered by a [central bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank).

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_policy>

## Monetary Policy

Monetary policyis the process by which the monetary authority of a country, typically the [central bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank) or [currency board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_board), controls either the [cost of very short-term borrowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds) or the [money supply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply), often targeting an [inflation rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation#Measures) or [interest rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate) to ensure [price stability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_stability) and general trust in the currency.

Further goals of a monetary policy are usually to contribute to the stability of [gross domestic product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product), to achieve and maintain low [unemployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment), and to maintain predictable [exchange rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rates) with other [currencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currencies).

[Monetary economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_economics) provides insight into how to craft an optimal monetary policy. In [developed countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_economy), monetary policy has generally been formed separately from [fiscal policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_policy), which refers to [taxation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax), [government spending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending), and [associated borrowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_borrowing).

Monetary policy is referred to as being either expansionary or contractionary. **Expansionary policy** occurs when a monetary authority uses its tools to stimulate the economy. An expansionary policy maintains short-term interest rates at a lower than usual rate or increases the total supply of money in the economy more rapidly than usual. It is traditionally used to try to combat [unemployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment) in a [recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession) by lowering [interest rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate_targeting) in the hope that less expensive credit will entice businesses into expanding. This increases [aggregate demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_demand)(the overall demand for all goods and services in an economy), which boosts short-term growth as measured by [gross domestic product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product)(GDP) growth. Expansionary monetary policy usually diminishes the value of the currency relative to other currencies (the [exchange rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate)).

The opposite of expansionary monetary policy is **contractionary monetary policy**, which maintains short-term interest rates higher than usual or which slows the rate of growth in the money supply or even shrinks it. This slows short-term economic growth and lessens [inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation). Contractionary monetary policy can lead to increased unemployment and depressed borrowing and spending by consumers and businesses, which can eventually result in an economic recession if implemented too vigorously.

## Repo Rate

Whenever banks want to borrow money they can borrow from the RBI. The rate at which RBI lends money to other banks is called the repo rate. If the repo rate is high that means the cost of borrowing is high, leading to slow growth in the economy. Currently, the repo rate in India is 8%. Markets don't like the RBI increasing the repo rates

## Reverse repo rate

Reverse Repo rate is the rate at which RBI borrows money from banks. When banks lend money to RBI they are certain that RBI will not default, and hence they are happier to lend their money to RBI as opposed to a corporate. However, when banks choose to lend money to the RBI instead of the corporate entity, the supply of money in the banking system reduces. An increase in reverse repo rate is not great for the economy as it tightens the supply of money. The reverse repo rate is currently at 7%

## Cash reserve ratio (CRR)

Every bank is mandatorily required to maintain funds with RBI. The amount that they maintain is dependent on the CRR. If CRR increases then more money is removed from the system, which is again not good for the economy

## Fiscal Deficit

A fiscal deficit occurs when a government's total expenditures exceed the revenue that it generates, excluding money from borrowings.[Deficit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deficit.asp) differs from debt, which is an accumulation of yearly deficits.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget_balance>

## Inflation

Inflation is a sustained increase in the general prices of goods and services. Increasing inflation erodes the purchasing power of money.

## Wholesale Price Index (WPI)

The WPI indicates the movement in prices at the wholesale level. It captures the price increase or decreases when they are sold between organizations as opposed to actual consumers. WPI is an easy and convenient method to calculate inflation. However, the inflation measured here is at an institutional level and does not necessarily capture the inflation experienced by the consumer.

## Consumer Price Index (CPI)

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure that examines the [weighted average](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/weightedaverage.asp) of prices of a basket of consumer goods and services, such as transportation, food and medical care. It is calculated by taking price changes for each item in the predetermined basket of goods and averaging them. Changes in the CPI are used to assess price changes associated with the [cost of living](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cost-of-living.asp); the CPI is one of the most frequently used statistics for identifying periods of inflation or deflation.

The computation of CPI is quite rigorous and detailed. It is one of the most critical metrics for studying the economy. A national statistical agency called the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI) publishes the CPI numbers around the 2ndweek of every month.

## Index of Industrial Production (IIP)

The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) is a short term indicator of how the industrial sector in the country is progressing. The data is released every month (along with inflation data) by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI). As the name suggests, the IIP measures the production in the Indian industrial sectors keeping a fixed reference point. As of today, India uses the reference point of 2004-05. The reference point is also called the base year.

Roughly about 15 different industries submit their production data to the ministry, which collates the data and releases it as an index number. If the IIP is increasing it indicates a vibrant industrial environment (as the production is going up) and hence a positive sign for the economy and markets. A decreasing IIP indicates a sluggish production environment, hence a negative sign for the economy and markets.

To sum up, an upswing in industrial production is good for the economy and a downswing rings an alarm. As India is getting more industrialized, the relative importance of the Index of Industrial Production is increasing.

A lower IIP number puts pressure on the RBI to lower the interest rates.

## Purchasing Managers Index (PMI)

The Purchasing managers' index (PMI) is an economic indicator that tries to capture the business activity across the manufacturing and service sectors in the country. This is a survey-based indicator where the respondents -- usually the purchasing managers indicate their change in business perception with respect to the previous month. A separate survey is conducted for the service and the manufacturing sectors. The data from the survey are consolidated on a single index. Typical areas covered in the survey include factors such as new orders, output, business expectations and employment amongst others.

The PMI number usually oscillates around 50. A reading above 50 indicates expansion and below 50 indicates a contraction in the economy. And reading at 50 indicates no change in the economy.

## NBFC (Non-Banking Financial Company) & MFI (Micro Finance Institutions)

A Non Banking Financial Company (NBFC) isa company registered under the Companies Act, 2013 of [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India), engaged in the business of loans and advances, acquisition of shares, stock, bonds, hire-purchase insurance business or chit-fund business, but does not include any institution whose principal business is that of agriculture, industrial activity, purchase or sale of any goods (other than securities) or providing any services and sale/purchase/construction of immovable property.
