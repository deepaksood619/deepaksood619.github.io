### GST vs Income Tax

Income Tax and GST are 2 completely different Acts and tax different things.

Mr. India earns INR 1 crore by selling services to Indian parties. This is professional income for Mr. India. GST on these services applies at 18%

#### GST

Mr. India will collect the following amount from his clients:

|Particulars|INR|
|---|---|
|Fees for services|1,00,00,000|
|Add: GST @ 18%|18,00,000|
|Total Collection|1,18,00,000|

This INR 18,00,000 of GST collected will be paid to the Government. Accordingly, **GST is an indirect tax - the clients bear the burden of this amount**.

#### Income Tax

Mr. India will be liable to pay income tax on this INR 1 crore at [slab rates](https://www.thegalacticadvisors.com/tax-rates-individual). This is a tax on your income - a Direct Tax. This goes out of your pocket.

### Foreign Income

For example, **if you receive Rs 1,00,000 as foreign remittance into your Indian bank account, you are liable to pay 18%**, i.e., Rs 18,000 as GST to the Indian government. If you receive foreign remittances not in INR but in a foreign currency, you are not liable to pay GST on the amount you received.
