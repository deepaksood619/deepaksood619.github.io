### GST vs Income Tax

Income Tax and GST are 2 completely different Acts and tax different things.

Mr. India earns INR 1 crore by selling services to Indian parties. This is professional income for Mr. India. GST on these services applies at 18%

#### GST

Mr. India will collect the following amount from his clients:

|Particulars|INR|
|---|---|
|Fees for services|1,00,00,000|
|Add: GST @ 18%|18,00,000|
|Total Collection|1,18,00,000|

This INR 18,00,000 of GST collected will be paid to the Government. Accordingly, **GST is an indirect tax - the clients bear the burden of this amount**.

#### Income Tax
