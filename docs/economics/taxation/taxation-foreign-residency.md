# Taxation - Foreign Residency

## Tired of taxes?

- **Low cost option:** open a brokerage account on global equities. Do not book any capital gains. When the account goes big, change your tax residency. And, book profits.
- **Expensive option:** setup a base in low-tax countries immediately. Enjoy perks (but for this, you need to meet a threshold).

## Low Cost Option

This is a sophisticated strategy often called "**jurisdictional arbitrage.**" It is legally feasible for an individual investor, provided you meticulously follow the tax laws of both India and your future country of residence.

Here is a step-by-step roadmap to executing this strategy, the specific risks involved, and the operational setup required.

### Phase 1: The Setup (While in India)

Your goal here is to minimize costs and ensure portability. If you open an account with a broker that only serves Indian residents, you may be forced to close the account (and sell the holdings, triggering tax) when you move abroad.

#### 1. Brokerage Selection: The Critical Choice

You need a brokerage that supports **account migration**.

- **Best Option:** **Interactive Brokers (IBKR)**.

    - **Why:** They operate globally. When you move to another country (e.g., Dubai or Singapore), you simply file a ticket to migrate your entity from "IBKR India" to "IBKR LLC/UK/etc." effectively keeping your portfolio intact without selling.
    - **Cost:** Very low. Commissions are negligible (~$0.35 to $2 per trade depending on the plan).
- **Alternatives:** Vested or INDmoney.
    - **Risk:** These often use US-based clearing partners (like DriveWealth). While they are excellent for staying in India, moving your account status to "Non-resident" while keeping the same account can sometimes be bureaucratically difficult or require a transfer of assets (ACATS), which costs money.

#### 2. Funding the Account (LRS & TCS)

- **The Mechanism:** You will use the **Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS)**.1 This allows every resident Indian to send up to **$250,000 USD** per financial year abroad.
- **The "Tax" Hit (TCS):** Any remittance above ₹7 Lakhs in a financial year attracts a 20% **Tax Collected at Source (TCS)**.
    - _Note:_ This is not a "cost" but an advance tax. You can claim this back as a refund when you file your India tax return (ITR), but it locks up your capital for a year.

#### 3. What "Global Equities" to Buy? (The Hidden Trap)

This is where most people fail. If you buy direct US stocks (e.g., Apple, Tesla, SPY ETF), you face two problems:

1. **US Estate Tax:** If you pass away while holding >$60,000 in US assets, the US government takes **40%** of your wealth above that limit. This applies even if you are not a US resident.
2. **Dividend Tax:** US dividends are taxed at a flat 25% (withheld) for Indians.

**The Solution:** Buy **Irish Domiciled UCITS ETFs**.

- These are ETFs (like Vanguard FTSE All-World) registered in Ireland.
- **Ticker examples (London Stock Exchange):** `VWRA` (Vanguard All-World), `CSPX` (iShares S&P 500).
- **Benefits:**
    - **No US Estate Tax** for non-US residents.
    - **Accumulating:** You can choose "Accumulating" versions (e.g., VWRA) which automatically reinvest dividends. This means you receive **zero** dividends in your bank account, saving you from paying dividend tax in India every year.

### Phase 2: The Exit (Changing Residency)

To stop paying capital gains tax in India, you must legally cease to be an Indian Tax Resident.

#### 1. The "182 Day" Rule

- To become a Non-Resident Indian (NRI) for tax purposes, you generally must stay in India for **less than 182 days** in that financial year.
- **Strategy:** Move out of India early in the financial year (e.g., April or May). By the time the next March 31st arrives, you will be a non-resident for that entire year.

#### 2. Does India have an "Exit Tax"?

- **Currently: No.** Unlike the US or some EU nations, India does not currently tax individuals on "unrealized gains" when they leave the country. You can leave with a portfolio worth $10M of unrealized profit, and the Indian taxman will not stop you.
- _Caveat:_ Tax laws change. Keep an eye on the "Direct Tax Code" developments.

#### 3. Changing Status with Broker

- Once you have your visa and proof of address in the new country, you inform Interactive Brokers. They will update your tax residency status.

### Phase 3: Booking Profits (The Destination)

You need to move to a jurisdiction with **0% Capital Gains Tax** for individuals.

**Top Jurisdictions:**

1. **UAE (Dubai):** The most popular. Zero personal income tax, zero capital gains tax.
2. **Singapore:** Zero capital gains tax, but high cost of living.
3. **Switzerland:** Generally tax-free capital gains for private investors (canton-dependent rules apply).

**The Payoff:**

- You sell your holdings (e.g., VWRA) while resident in Dubai.
- **India Tax:** ₹0 (Because you are a non-resident selling a foreign asset).
- **Dubai Tax:** $0.
- **US Tax:** $0 (Because you hold Irish ETFs, not US situs assets).

### Summary of Risks & "Gotchas"

| **Risk**               | **Description**                                      | **Mitigation**                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Exchange Rate**      | You convert INR to USD (Loss ~0.5% - 1%) and back.   | Use low-markup banks (e.g., IDFC First, IndusInd) or platforms like Wise (if supported for LRS).                          |
| **US Estate Tax**      | 40% tax on death if holding US assets >$60k.         | **Strictly buy Irish Domiciled ETFs** (UCITS) trading on the London Stock Exchange, not NYSE.                             |
| **POEM Risk**          | "Place of Effective Management".                     | If you run a company, just moving yourself doesn't work. This strategy works best for **personal** investment portfolios. |
| **Returning to India** | If you return to India, you become a resident again. | You must realize (book) your profits **before** you return to India permanently.                                          |
