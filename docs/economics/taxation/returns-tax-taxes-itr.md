### 44ADA - Presumptive Tax Scheme for Professionals

The benefit of section 44ADA can be taken only by those specified professionals whose annual gross receipts are under Rs.50 lakh (This limit is **Rs.75 lakh**, provided 95% of the receipts are through recognised banking channels).

The presumptive scheme of taxation reduces the compliance burden on small professions and facilitates ease of doing business. Under the presumptive scheme of taxation, profits/taxable income is presumed at 50% of the gross receipts.

Taxes can be significantly reduced. For 60 lakh under 44ADA tax is only around 7L instead of 12L in normal method.
