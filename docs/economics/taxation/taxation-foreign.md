# Taxation - Foriegn

## Foreign Stocks

### ITR Form to disclose foreign investments

You should choose the right ITR form to report these details in order to avoid any Income Tax notice. If a taxpayer has foreign investments, he or she will have to disclose the same in the Schedule of Foreign Assets (FA) using the Form ITR-2 or ITR-3.

### Who should declare foreign assets?

Taxpayers need to mandatorily declare all their foreign assets in the ITR, and that also includes investments in US stocks or assets in any other countries. If an individual has taxable income that is below the basic exemption limit of Rs 3 lakh but has stocks in foreign countries, he or she will still need to file the ITR to disclose the stock holdings.

Foreign stocks have to be declared in the ITR every year until the taxpayer has their name on it. In case of failure to declare the foreign stocks or any foreign asset like real estate, bank deposits, accounts, or insurance policies, the taxpayer will be liable to inspection by the tax department under the Black Money and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015. Besides the scrutiny, they can be penalised with up to Rs 10 lakh fine.

### Taxation for foreign investments and stocks

In India, when a foreign stock is sold after a term of two years, the profit earned from it is treated as long-term capital gains (LTCG) and is taxed at 20 percent (surcharge extra), with indexation benefit. While short-term capital gains (STCG) are taxed at the income slab rates. There is no tax liability on capital gains for the foreign-born.

Also, the dividend income earned on foreign investments is taxed at the pre-defined tax slab rates in India. In the US, when the dividend is paid, the government withholds a flat 25 percent as tax. India has a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) with the US, due to which one can claim the tax paid in the US to avoid the tax liability in India while filing the ITR.

#### Dividend for msft stocks

Basically the only issue will come with dividends (this is missed in 26AS and needs to be declared to avoid discrepancy), and while declaring we give a tax for ~31.2% in the portal afaik. However the US laws state that 25% to be deducted for indians earning dividends in US firms. So form 67 needs to be filled in for taking back the extra 25% we paid for the dividends.
