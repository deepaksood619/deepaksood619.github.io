## Irish Domiciled (UCITS) ETFs

Domiciled outside US - Replacing VOO, QQQ & VT with CSPX, SXRV & VWRA
	- VWRA - Vanguard FTSE All-World UCITS ETF USD Acc

You must strictly buy the **Accumulating** version. This ensures dividends are reinvested inside the fund automatically. You never receive cash in your bank account, so you generally don't trigger "Dividend Income" tax in India each year.

### Top 3 "Buy & Forget" Global ETFs (LSE Listed)

These trade on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) but are denominated in **USD**.

|**Feature**|**1. VWRA (The Gold Standard)**|**2. ISAC (The Challenger)**|**3. IWDA / SWDA (Developed Only)**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Full Name**|Vanguard FTSE All-World UCITS ETF (Acc)|iShares MSCI ACWI UCITS ETF (Acc)|iShares Core MSCI World UCITS ETF (Acc)|
|**Ticker**|`VWRA`|`ISAC` (or `SSAC`)|`IWDA` (or `SWDA`)|
|**Provider**|Vanguard|BlackRock (iShares)|BlackRock (iShares)|
|**What it buys**|**Whole World** (Developed + Emerging Markets)|**Whole World** (Developed + Emerging Markets)|**Developed Markets Only** (US, UK, Japan, etc. — **No India/China**)|
|**No. of Stocks**|~3,700|~2,400|~1,500|

|**Fund Size**|Huge (High Liquidity)|Large|Massive|
|**Dividend Policy**|**Accumulating** (Reinvested)|**Accumulating** (Reinvested)|**Accumulating** (Reinvested)|

### Which one should you pick?

#### Option A: The "One-Stop Shop" (Recommended)

**Choose:** **VWRA** (Vanguard) or **ISAC** (iShares).

- **Why:** These two are almost identical. They cover the **entire planet**. You get exposure to the US (Apple, Microsoft), Europe, **plus** Emerging Markets (China, India, Brazil) in one single ticker.
- **The slight edge:** `VWRA` is often preferred by the "FIRE" (Financial Independence) community because it tracks the _FTSE All-World_ index, which includes slightly more medium/small-cap companies than the _MSCI ACWI_ index used by ISAC.

#### Option B: The "Developed Markets Only"

**Choose:** **IWDA** (iShares).

- **Why:** If you believe Emerging Markets (like India/China) are risky or will underperform, you buy this. It invests _only_ in developed economies (mostly USA, Japan, Europe).
- **The Trap:** If you live in India, you are _already_ heavily exposed to the Indian economy (your job, your house, your rupees). Many investors skip Emerging Markets in their global portfolio to avoid "doubling down" on risk. However, for a true "global citizen" strategy, Option A is safer.

### Critical "How-To" for Interactive Brokers (IBKR)

When you search for these on IBKR, you will see multiple versions (listing on different exchanges like LSE, AEB, EBS).

**You must select the correct one to ensure liquidity and USD currency:**

1. **Search Ticker:** Type `VWRA`.
2. **Select Exchange:** Choose **LSE (London Stock Exchange)**.
3. **Currency:** Ensure it says **USD**.
    - _Note:_ You might see `VWRP` (same fund, but in GBP). **Do not buy that** unless you hold Pounds. You want `VWRA` (USD) to match the dollars you sent via LRS.

## Nasdaq Composite vs Nasdaq 100
