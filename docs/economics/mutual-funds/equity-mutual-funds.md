# Equity Mutual Funds

## Equity funds or growth funds

### What is difference in Multi Asset Fund & other Hybrid funds?

Hybrid funds are mutual funds that invest in both equity (shares) and debt (fixed income securities, bonds, etc).

They are also called balanced funds.

There are a few kinds of hybrid funds.

Multi-asset funds are also hybrid in nature but there’s one major difference. They have to invest in at least 3 different assets and must invest at least 10% in each of those assets.

For example, a multi-asset fund might invest in equity, debt, as well as gold.

### Multi-Cap Funds vs Flexi-Cap (Flexicap) Funds

Flexi-cap and multi-cap funds both invest across large, mid, and small-cap stocks, but **multi-cap funds have a mandate to invest a minimum of 25% in each market cap category**, while flexi-cap funds have more flexibility in allocating investments across market caps.

| **Risks**                   | A Multi-Cap Fund, by definition, invests in the stocks of large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap corporations.

This could result in a portfolio with a strong mix of stocks that produces moderate returns. Furthermore, if held for a long time, this fund offers a lot of flexibility in managing the risk associated with [market volatility](https://groww.in/p/volatility).                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Tax Implications**        | The post-tax returns are what count. To determine that, you should be aware of the taxation of Multi-Cap Funds.

Gains over one lakh rupees are subject to a 10% tax. | A Flexi-Cap Fund is regarded as an [Equity Mutual Fund](https://groww.in/p/equity-funds) under the Income Tax Act, making gains from investments in this category subject to a lower tax rate. Any profit realized within a year is considered short-term and is subject to a flat [tax](https://groww.in/p/tax) of 15%.

## 10(10D) Funds

Section 10(10D) of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961, allows for a **tax exemption on certain sums received** from a life insurance policy. This can include death benefits, maturity amounts, and bonuses. While death benefits are generally fully tax-exempt, the exemption for maturity or surrender benefits is subject to conditions related to the annual premium paid relative to the sum assured. For policies issued after April 1, 2012, the premium must not exceed 10% of the sum assured, and for policies issued between April 1, 2003, and March 31, 2012, the limit is 20%. Policies for individuals with disability or specific ailments issued after April 1, 2013, have a 15% premium limit.

### Limits

Recent amendments introduced premium caps for tax-free maturity benefits on high-value policies. For ULIPs issued on or after February 1, 2021, the aggregate annual premium should not exceed ₹2.5 lakh for tax-free maturity. For non-linked policies (excluding ULIPs) issued on or after April 1, 2023, the aggregate annual premium limit for tax-free maturity is ₹5 lakh. If these premium limits are exceeded, maturity proceeds become taxable. The sum received on the death of the insurer is always tax-free irrespective of the premium paid.

The Section 10(10D) exemption does not apply to amounts from a Keyman insurance policy, benefits received under disability-related sections, or annuity/pension payouts. Other relevant tax sections include Section 80C for premium deductions and Section 80D for health-related riders.

As per the amendments, [**ULIP plans**](https://www.tataaia.com/life-insurance-plans/wealth-solutions.html) will be categorised as capital assets. All maturity, surrender, or partial withdrawal proceeds will be taxed to the policyholder as Capital Gains.

### Are the life insurance maturity benefits taxable?

In accordance with Section 10(10D), life insurance maturity benefits will be tax-free. But there are two conditions to qualify for the tax exemptions:

- If the policy was acquired before April 1, 2012, the premium amount should not exceed 20% of the insurance coverage.
- If the policy was obtained after April 1, 2012, **the premium amount should not be more than 10% of the insurance coverage.**

### Policies / ULIPs

ULIP's are a scam and trash - No its not. Ulips via RM is trash. There is a separate category of ULIPs which are direct and not available via RM. You pay mortality charges until your corpus is less than cover, after that around 1.5% fund management charges and no capital gains. 5 year lockin. Pay via cc, and 0 premium allocation charges.
