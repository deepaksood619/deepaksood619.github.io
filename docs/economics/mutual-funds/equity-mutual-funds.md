#### What is difference in Multi Asset Fund & other Hybrid funds?

Hybrid funds are mutual funds that invest in both equity (shares) and debt (fixed income securities, bonds, etc).

They are also called balanced funds.

There are a few kinds of hybrid funds.

Multi-asset funds are also hybrid in nature but there’s one major difference. They have to invest in at least 3 different assets and must invest at least 10% in each of those assets.

For example, a multi-asset fund might invest in equity, debt, as well as gold.
