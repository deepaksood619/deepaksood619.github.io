# Fixed income

Fixed income refers to any type of [investment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment) under which the borrower or issuer is obliged to make payments of a fixed amount on a fixed schedule. For example, the borrower may have to pay [interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest) at a fixed rate once a year, and to repay the principal amount on maturity. Fixed-income [securities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)) can be contrasted with equity securities -- often referred to as stocks and shares -- that create no obligation to pay dividends or any other form of income.

In order for a company to grow its business, it often must raise money -- for example, to finance an acquisition; to buy equipment or land; or to invest in new product development. The terms on which investors will finance the company will depend on the risk profile of the company. The company can give up [equity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ownership_equity) by issuing stock, or can promise to pay regular [interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest) and repay the principal on the loan (bonds or bank loans). Fixed-income securities also trade differently than equities. Whereas equities, such as common stock, trade on exchanges or other established trading venues, many fixed-income securities trade over-the-counter on a principal basis.

The term "fixed" in "fixed income" refers to both the schedule of obligatory payments and the amount. "Fixed income securities" can be distinguished from [inflation-indexed bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation-indexed_bond), variable-interest rate notes, and the like. If an issuer misses a payment on a fixed income security, the issuer is in [default](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_(finance)), and depending on the relevant law and the structure of the security, the payees may be able to force the issuer into [bankruptcy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy). In contrast, if a company misses a quarterly dividend to stock (non-fixed-income) shareholders, there is no violation of any payment covenant, and no default.

The term fixed income is also applied to a person's income that does not vary materially over time. This can include income derived from fixed-income investments such as bonds and [preferred stocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_stock) or [pensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension) that guarantee a fixed income. When pensioners or retirees are dependent on their pension as their dominant source of income, the term "fixed income" can also carry the implication that they have relatively limited [discretionary income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretionary_income) or have little financial freedom to make large or discretionary expenditures.

**Pension fund** is a retirement savings plan where a portion of your salary is set aside for your future. The funds are managed by a trustee and typically paid out as a monthly pension after retirement. **Provident fund** is similar, but the entire balance is paid out as a lump sum, not as a monthly pension.

## Long-term emergency funds

This is where you save for large-scale emergencies like a major natural disaster or a sudden medical emergency. This fund should be invested in instruments that allow you to earn a slightly higher rate of interest but may take a couple of days to liquidate.

## Short-term emergency funds

This is the fund you rush to in cases of emergencies. Such a fund should offer little in terms of interest but allow immediate accessibility, which in case of extreme situations can suffice till you gain access to your long-term emergency funds.

[Premature FD Withdrawal: Avoid Interest Loss - Bajaj Finance](https://www.bajajfinserv.in/investments/avoid-interest-loss-on-premature-fd)

The rate of interest offered on tends to be higher for longer tenures. An FD with a longer tenure is set to fetch you better returns than a shorter-term FD this is because of the power of compounding. As you can see, a 4-year FD can yield returns up to 8.05% p.a., whereas a 1-year FD would offer 7.40% p.a. which is lower than the former. Also, if you wish to prematurely withdraw your FD, you will be **charged interest as per the rate on the day of opening your account for the actual period your account was open.**

[Premature Withdrawal of Fixed Deposit (FD) Online - Bajaj Finance](https://www.bajajfinserv.in/service-guides/withdraw-your-fd-prematurely-in-my-account)

- If there‚Äôs any unforeseen expense, you can withdraw the funds that you‚Äôve parked in a fixed deposit before its maturity date. This is called the premature withdrawal of a fixed deposit. However, you can raise a request for premature withdrawal after three months from the date of acceptance of the deposit.
- If you withdraw your FD after three months but before six months from the date of deposit, you‚Äôll only get the principal amount. You won‚Äôt get any interest amount in such a case.
- However, if you choose to prematurely liquidate FD after six months, the interest payable is 2% (per annum) lower than the interest rate applicable to a public deposit for the period for which it has run.
- If no rate has been specified for that period, the interest rate payable is 3% (per annum) lower than the minimum interest rate at which public deposits are accepted by the NBFC.
- As of 2025-09-21 **FD withdrawn are credited in under 24 hours even on Saturdays/Sundays**

## Tax-Free Bonds (Tax Free Bonds)

Tax-free bonds are fixed-income instruments, and as per section 10(15) of the Income Tax Act of 1961, any earnings from this bond are exempted from tax. These bonds usually have a maturity period of 10-20 years and provide a low-interest rate on those bonds.

Tax-free bonds are a type of fixed income investment where the interest paid to the bondholders is exempt from income tax. These bonds are issued by government entities like government companies, municipal corporations, public sector undertakings, and other infrastructure companies.

These bonds have been introduced in India to finance government and infrastructure projects, while also providing an investment option to individuals with a tax-saving benefit. Many states in India issue tax-free bonds for raising capital for infrastructure development.

#### Who issues tax-free bonds?

Tax-free bonds are issued by entities that are backed, set up, or incorporated by the government to fund projects aimed at national development. These projects often involve infrastructure, housing, and urban development. In India, for example, the Power Finance Corporation Limited issues tax-free bonds to support the development of the power sector. Other common issuers include:

1. National Highway Authority of India (NHAI)
2. Power Finance Corporation Limited (PFC)
3. Indian Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL)
4. Housing and Urban Development Corporation Limited (HUDCO)
5. Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited (IREDA)
6. Rural Electrification Corporation Limited (REC)
7. National Housing Bank (NHB)
8. NHPC Limited (formerly National Hydroelectric Power Corporation Ltd.)
9. NTPC Limited (formerly National Thermal Power Corporation)

These entities issue¬†tax free bonds to raise funds for their respective projects, contributing to the nation's growth and development.

#### What are the common types of tax-free bonds?

1. Infrastructure bonds
2. Housing bonds
3. Power bonds
4. Railway bonds
5. Public sector unit bonds

#### How do tax-free bonds work?

Investing in tax-free bonds just requires a Demat account, and investors can buy or sell these bonds on the stock exchange. They can also use online trading platforms like the one from Bajaj Financial Securities Limited (BFSL). The interest earned on these bonds is tax-exempt and is directly credited to the investor's bank account.

These bonds listed on the stock exchanges offer flexibility in terms of liquidity. Due to their tax-exempt status,¬†tax free bonds usually face high demand and low supply, especially during the tax-saving season.

#### Factors To checklist before investing in tax-free bonds

1. **Investment goals:** Before investing in tax-free bonds, determine your investment goals, such as earning tax-exempt income, preserving capital, or liquidity.
2. **Investment horizon:** Consider the duration of the investment and match it with your financial goals.
3. **Research:**¬†Thoroughly research the available tax-free bonds, including government bonds and municipal bonds. Compare interest rates, credit ratings, and other relevant factors to suit your investment goals.
4. **Brokerage:** Choose a reputable stockbroker, such as a traditional broker or an online broker, who specialises in tax-free bond investments.
5. **Open a Demat and trading account:** Open a Demat and trading account with the chosen broker. The process may require filling out an application and providing personal information.
6. **Purchase the bonds:** Once you have selected a tax-free bond, decide on the number of bonds you want to purchase and complete the transaction through your broker.
7. **Risk management:** Remember that tax-free bonds are subject to credit risk, market risk, and interest rate risk. Be aware of these risks and consult with a financial advisor on ways to minimise them.
