# Fixed income

Fixed income refers to any type of [investment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment) under which the borrower or issuer is obliged to make payments of a fixed amount on a fixed schedule. For example, the borrower may have to pay [interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest) at a fixed rate once a year, and to repay the principal amount on maturity. Fixed-income [securities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)) can be contrasted with equity securities -- often referred to as stocks and shares -- that create no obligation to pay dividends or any other form of income.

In order for a company to grow its business, it often must raise money -- for example, to finance an acquisition; to buy equipment or land; or to invest in new product development. The terms on which investors will finance the company will depend on the risk profile of the company. The company can give up [equity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ownership_equity) by issuing stock, or can promise to pay regular [interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest) and repay the principal on the loan (bonds or bank loans). Fixed-income securities also trade differently than equities. Whereas equities, such as common stock, trade on exchanges or other established trading venues, many fixed-income securities trade over-the-counter on a principal basis.

The term "fixed" in "fixed income" refers to both the schedule of obligatory payments and the amount. "Fixed income securities" can be distinguished from [inflation-indexed bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation-indexed_bond), variable-interest rate notes, and the like. If an issuer misses a payment on a fixed income security, the issuer is in [default](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_(finance)), and depending on the relevant law and the structure of the security, the payees may be able to force the issuer into [bankruptcy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy). In contrast, if a company misses a quarterly dividend to stock (non-fixed-income) shareholders, there is no violation of any payment covenant, and no default.

The term fixed income is also applied to a person's income that does not vary materially over time. This can include income derived from fixed-income investments such as bonds and [preferred stocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_stock) or [pensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension) that guarantee a fixed income. When pensioners or retirees are dependent on their pension as their dominant source of income, the term "fixed income" can also carry the implication that they have relatively limited [discretionary income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretionary_income) or have little financial freedom to make large or discretionary expenditures.

**Pension fund** is a retirement savings plan where a portion of your salary is set aside for your future. The funds are managed by a trustee and typically paid out as a monthly pension after retirement. **Provident fund** is similar, but the entire balance is paid out as a lump sum, not as a monthly pension.

## Long-term emergency funds

This is where you save for large-scale emergencies like a major natural disaster or a sudden medical emergency. This fund should be invested in instruments that allow you to earn a slightly higher rate of interest but may take a couple of days to liquidate.

## Short-term emergency funds

This is the fund you rush to in cases of emergencies. Such a fund should offer little in terms of interest but allow immediate accessibility, which in case of extreme situations can suffice till you gain access to your long-term emergency funds.
