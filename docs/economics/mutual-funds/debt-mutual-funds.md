# Debt Mutual Funds

### Debt MF Risk

#### Cashflow risk

The borrower can skip paying a couple of EMIs and make irregular repayments. Irregular repayments mean that the bank will take a hit on the expected cash flow, potentially leading to a chain of undesirable events

#### Default risk

The borrower may get into an insolvent situation wherein servicing the loan becomes very difficult; hence the borrower decides not to repay. This is called 'default' or the 'default risk'.

#### Interest rate risk

The loan is given out at a specific interest rate. However, the economic situation may change, and the interest rates may drop in the future. This means that the bank will be forced to reduce the rates, and hence the expected cash flow takes a hit.

#### Credit rating risk

The bank evaluates the borrower's credit rating at the time of giving out the loan. At this point, the borrower's credit rating could be excellent. However, for whatever reasons, the credit rating of the borrower can suddenly degrade, thereby increasing the chance of default risk.

#### Asset risk

In case the borrower defaults, the bank has the right to sell the hypothecated property. What if the property itself loses its value? This is a double whammy situation for the lender or the bank. The bank loses both the principal and the asset.

## Debt Funds / Income Funds / Bond Funds

- Quantum Liquid Fund + ICICI Arbitrage Fund

They are a type of mutual funds that invest primarily in fixed income instruments (such as bonds) issued by government, public and private companies. These funds get interest from these borrowers, which is then reflected in the returns of debt investments.

Debt funds, alternatively known as fixed-income funds or credit funds, come under the fixed income asset category of mutual funds. They are low-risk investments vehicles and are comparatively more secure than equity funds which are subject to volatile market forces.

There are several avenues through which you can invest in the best performing debt funds for higher returns. It can be long-term or short-term bonds, monthly income plans (MIPs), floating-rate debt, money market instruments, fixed maturity plans (FMPs) or security products.

Debt Mutual Funds can be broadly classified into:

- **Theme based:** SEBI has defined some categories based on the kind of instruments the mutual fund invests in, for example, corporate bonds, Government bonds, etc.
- **Duration based:** These funds are based on maturity or Macaulay duration of the fund. The Macaulay Duration is the time taken for a bond to repay its own purchase price in present value terms.

Below are ten such duration based categories of debt funds as defined by SEBI:

| **Category of Schemes** | **Macaulay Duration [Volatility increases with duration]** | **3 Year Annualised Returns** |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Overnight Funds         | Maturity up to 1 Day                                       | 6.39 %                        |
| Liquid Funds | Maturity up to 91 Days | 6.85 % |
| Ultra Short Duration Funds| Between 3 to 6 Months | 7.34 % |
| Low Duration Funds | Between 6 to 12 Months | 7.88 % |
| Money Market Funds | Maturity up to 1 Year | 7.31 % |
| Short Duration Funds | Between 1 to 3 Years | 7.74 % |
| Medium Duration Funds| Between 3 to 4 Years | 7.90 % |
| Medium to Long Duration Funds | Between 4 to 7 Years | 7.05 % |
| Long Duration Funds | Greater than 7 Years | 8.60 % |
| Dynamic Bond Fund |  |  |
| Corporate Bond Fund |  |  |
| Credit Risk Fund |  |  |
| Banking and PSU Fund |  |  |
| Gilt Fund |  |  |
| Gilt with 10Y constant duration fund |  |  |
| Floater Fund |  |  |
| IDCW - Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal / Dividend plans |  |  |

**Recurring deposits and fixed deposits can be terribly tax-inefficient for those in the 20% and 30% slabs. Primarily because the gains have to declared and tax paid each financial year. A debt mutual fund is a natural choice.**

Debt mutual fund schemes that invest in fixed income instruments, such as Bonds, and money market instruments etc. that offer capital appreciation.

There are three options with debt funds:

- Stick to money market funds like liquid, overnight or very short-term bond funds with reasonable credit quality. The risk of loss is low(er) but over the long term, returns will gradually head south.

- Avoid all credit risk and use only long term gilt funds. See for example [SBI Magnum Constant Maturity Fund: A Debt Fund With Low Credit Risk for long term goals!](https://freefincal.com/sbi-magnum-constant-maturity-fund/) The NAV here will be highly volatile and the investor must practice and mix of annual rebalancing (aka strategic) and tactical rebalancing as per bond yield movements. This does not involve much effort.

- Take on a mix of credit and interest rate risk. The management effort is less, returns can be higher than money market funds but there is always a risk of bond defaults. To negate that, choice of fund selection and monthly monitoring of the portfolio is crucial.

It is important for investors to understand that there is no escape from risk whatever choice they make. It is only a question of **familiar risk vs unfamiliar risk**. **Comfortable risk vs uncomfortable risk**. Sadly, when it comes to returns, we study the past and take it seriously. When it comes to risk, we ignore the past and assume what did not cause a loss is not risky.

1. Do not use debt funds if you do not have an idea of how volatile they can be.
    - Youcan use the [Multi-index Mutual Fund Rolling Returns Calculator](https://freefincal.com/multi-index-mutual-fund-rolling-returns-calculator/) to get the above graphs for the fund that hold or aim to invest in.

2. The average maturity of the portfolio should be much lower than the investment duration of the fund.
    - If your investment duration is 3 years, then an average maturity of a few months is good (liquid funds)
    - If your investment duration is 10 years, then an average maturity of 1-2 years is good.
        - Ultra-short-termfunds ~ 1Y.
        - Short-term gilts ~1-3Y if you want to avoid credit risk.
        - Income funds from solid bonds from banks and PSUs or a bit of corporate debt ~ 1-3Y is also okay.

3. A fixed deposit is a wonderful product for investment durations less than 3 years. After all, [there is more to investing than obtaining real returns](https://freefincal.com/there-is-more-to-investing-than-obtaining-real-returns/)

## Gilt funds

Gilt funds are debt funds that invest in government securities. The government bonds used to be issued in golden-edged certificates. The nickname gilt comes from gilded edge certificates. As per Sebi norms, gilt funds have the mandate to invest at least 80% of their assets in government securities.

There are two kinds of gilt funds

1. gilt funds that invest mostly in government securities across maturities.
2. gilt funds with constant maturity of 10 years -- these funds must invest at least 80% of their assets in government securities with a maturity of 10 years.

Investors should keep in mind that since these schemes invest in government securities, they have zero default risk. However, they have very high interest rate risk. In fact, government securities set the tone for interest rates in the money market and economy. The mostly traded 10-year government security is considered the benchmark. Its yield movement sets the tone for trading in the bond market. For example, traders look for trading opportunities based on the spread or interest rate difference between government bonds and corporate bonds or between the 10-year bond and other government bonds.

Finally, invest in gilt funds only if you can keep track of the interest rate movements and time your entry and exit in these schemes. Always remember that their extreme sensitivity to interest rate movements in the economy. This means gilt schemes may start going up or down, depending on the interest rate outlook. The RBI action might come later.

An arbitrage fund held for several years might be an underutilization of funds. I wanted the possibility of a bit more return than arbitrage -- meaning more volatility but not as much equity.

There two categories here: the 10-year gilts and the normal gilts. The 10-year gilt is the closest we have to a debt index fund but is the most volatile among the lot.
