## Debt Burden Ratio (DBR) / Debt to Income Ratio (DTI)

The debt-to-income (DTI) ratio is a personal finance measure that compares an individual's monthly debt payment to his or her monthly [gross income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossincome.asp). Your gross income is your pay before taxes and other deductions are taken out. The debt-to-income ratio is the percentage of your gross monthly income that goes to paying your monthly debt payments.

- The debt-to-income (DTI) ratio measures the amount of income a person or organization generates in order to service a debt.
- A DTI of 43% is typically the highest ratio a borrower can have and still get qualified for a mortgage, but lenders generally seek ratios of no more than 36%.
- A low DTI ratio indicates sufficient income relative to debt servicing, and makes a borrower more attractive.

They are considered extremely safe and conservative, especially during volatile times"

## CAS (Consolidated Account Statement)

## Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) / Rupee Cost Averaging / SIP

Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy in which an investor divides up the total amount to be invested across periodic purchases of a target asset in an effort to reduce the impact of volatility on the overall purchase. The purchases occur regardless of the asset's price and at regular intervals.

- Dollar-cost averaging refers to the practice of systematically investing equal amounts, spaced out over regular intervals, regardless of price.
- The goal of dollar-cost averaging is to reduce the overall impact of volatility on the price of the target asset; as the price will likely vary each time one of the periodic investments is made, the investment is not as highly subject to volatility.
- Dollar-cost averaging aims to avoid making the mistake of making one lump-sum investment that is poorly timed with regard to asset pricing.

## Fixed vs Floating Interest Rate

- A floating exchange rate is determined by the private market through supply and demand.
- A fixed, or pegged, rate is a rate the government (central bank) sets and maintains as the official exchange rate.
- The reasons to peg a currency are linked to stability. Especially in today's developing nations, a country may decide to peg its currency to create a stable atmosphere for foreign investment.
