## Modern Portfolio Theory

<https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp>

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory>

## Permanent Portfolio

- **Stocks**(25%) When the markets do well. Direct equity or mutual funds. Even an index fund should do.
- **Cash**(25%) during a recession. For example a liquid fund
- **Gold**(25%) during inflation
- **Long Term Bonds**(25%) during deflation and prosperity

Invest half the Indian equity investment in index funds (Nifty50 and Nifty Next50 with 75:25 allocation) and the remaining equally in 3 to 4 multicap funds managed by fund managers with a proven track record of over ten years. Up to 20% of the equity portfolio can be kept in foreign equity index funds

Young professional investors should allocate around 70% of their investable amount in Equity, 20% in Precious metals, and the rest in Fixed income investments. A retired person could invest 80 percent of his saving in fixed income, 10 percent in equity markets and 10 percent in precious metals.

- Above that and only above that, a third fund can be added to reduce concentration and performance risk

- For a one-fund equity portfolio
  - Single aggressive hybrid fund or single large and midcap or single multi-cap fund with do
- For a three-fund portfolio:
  - Combo 1 - Large-cap, Aggressive hybrid, mid-cap

## The Core Satellite Strategy

![image](../../media/TODO-Financial-Finance-Investing_Portfolios-image6.jpg)

Let us say, a market participant has a corpus of Rs.500,000/-. This corpus can be split into two unequal portions, for example the split can be 60 -- 40. The 60% of capital which is Rs.300,000/- can be invested for a long term period in fundamentally strong companies. This 60% of the investment makes up the core of the portfolio. One can expect the core portfolio to grow at a rate of at least 12% to 15% CAGR year on year basis.

The balance 40% of the amount, which is Rs.200,000/- can be utilized for active short term trading using Technical Analysis technique on equity, futures, and options. The Satellite portfolio can be expected to yield at least 10% to 12% absolute return on a yearly basis.
