## LTCG

To prevent gains from building up, experts suggest harvesting. This means booking a portion of your profits and reinvesting the proceeds. So you sell a part of your equity holdings to book long term capital gains, and then buy back the same shares or mutual fund units.

Harvest losses too when you still can

This exercise can be replicated even when you are investing via SIPs in mutual funds. If you started the SIP about a year ago, start redeeming units after they complete a year and reinvest the proceeds in the same or different fund. This will reset the buying price and ensure your capital gains do not overshoot the Rs 1 lakh tax free threshold.

if you are not able to set off your entire capital loss in the same year, you can carry forward these losses for up to 8 assessment years.

## Taxability

For taxation purposes, all mutual funds with investments lower than 65% in equity instruments are considered debt funds. Short-term capital gains of less than 36 months are taxed corresponding to the investor's income tax slab.

A tax rate of 20% is levied on long-term capital gains above 36 months after indexation. Indexation refers to the adjustment of the price of debt funds after factoring in the inflation between the years when that fund was purchased and the year when you sell them. This adjustment allows for the inflation of purchase price, thereby bringing down the overall quantum of capital gains. Subsequently, your taxable income reduces proportionately.

## Indexation

Indexation is a technique to adjust income payments by means of a price index, in order to maintain the purchasing power of the public after inflation, while deindexation is the unwinding ofindexation.

### Unrealized Gains / Unrealized Loss / "paper" profits or losses

An unrealized gain is a potential profit that exists on paper, resulting from an investment. It is an increase in the value of an [asset](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp) that has yet to be sold for cash, such as a stock position that has increased in value but still remains open. A gain becomes [realized](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realizedprofit.asp) once the position is sold for a profit.

### Key Takeaways

- An unrealized gain is a theoretical profit that exists on paper, resulting from an investment that has not yet been sold for cash.
- Unrealized gains are recorded on the financial statements differently depending on the type of security.
- Gains do not affect taxes until the investment is sold and a realized gain is recognized.
