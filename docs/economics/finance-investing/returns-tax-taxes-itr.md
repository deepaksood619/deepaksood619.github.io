### Direct and indirect taxes

- Direct taxes are paid directly to the government and are levied on one's income and profits.
- Indirect taxes are totally opposite and are paid to the government if one makes any purchases of goods and services.

### GST vs Income Tax

Income Tax and GST are 2 completely different Acts and tax different things.

Mr. India earns INR 1 crore by selling services to Indian parties. This is professional income for Mr. India. GST on these services applies at 18%

#### GST

Mr. India will collect the following amount from his clients:

|Particulars|INR|
|---|---|
|Fees for services|1,00,00,000|
|Add: GST @ 18%|18,00,000|
|Total Collection|1,18,00,000|

This INR 18,00,000 of GST collected will be paid to the Government. Accordingly, **GST is an indirect tax - the clients bear the burden of this amount**.

#### Income Tax

Mr. India will be liable to pay income tax on this INR 1 crore at [slab rates](https://www.thegalacticadvisors.com/tax-rates-individual). This is a tax on your income - a Direct Tax. This goes out of your pocket.

## LTCG / Tax Loss Harvesting

To prevent gains from building up, experts suggest harvesting. This means booking a portion of your profits and reinvesting the proceeds. So you sell a part of your equity holdings to book long term capital gains, and then buy back the same shares or mutual fund units.

Harvest losses too when you still can

This exercise can be replicated even when you are investing via SIPs in mutual funds. If you started the SIP about a year ago, start redeeming units after they complete a year and reinvest the proceeds in the same or different fund. This will reset the buying price and ensure your capital gains do not overshoot the Rs 1 lakh tax free threshold.

if you are not able to set off your entire capital loss in the same year, you can carry forward these losses for up to 8 assessment years.

## Taxability

For taxation purposes, all mutual funds with investments lower than 65% in equity instruments are considered debt funds. Short-term capital gains of less than 36 months are taxed corresponding to the investor's income tax slab.

A tax rate of 20% is levied on long-term capital gains above 36 months after indexation. Indexation refers to the adjustment of the price of debt funds after factoring in the inflation between the years when that fund was purchased and the year when you sell them. This adjustment allows for the inflation of purchase price, thereby bringing down the overall quantum of capital gains. Subsequently, your taxable income reduces proportionately.

## Indexation

Indexation is a technique to adjust income payments by means of a price index, in order to maintain the purchasing power of the public after inflation, while de-indexation is the unwinding of indexation.

### Unrealized Gains / Unrealized Loss / "paper" profits or losses

An unrealized gain is a potential profit that exists on paper, resulting from an investment. It is an increase in the value of an [asset](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp) that has yet to be sold for cash, such as a stock position that has increased in value but still remains open. A gain becomes [realized](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realizedprofit.asp) once the position is sold for a profit.

### Key Takeaways

- An unrealized gain is a theoretical profit that exists on paper, resulting from an investment that has not yet been sold for cash.
- Unrealized gains are recorded on the financial statements differently depending on the type of security.
- Gains do not affect taxes until the investment is sold and a realized gain is recognized.

## Stocks Tax

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfX-esge_3o

## Foreign Stocks

### ITR Form to disclose foreign investments

You should choose the right ITR form to report these details in order to avoid any Income Tax notice. If a taxpayer has foreign investments, he or she will have to disclose the same in the Schedule of Foreign Assets (FA) using the Form ITR-2 or ITR-3.

### Who should declare foreign assets?

Taxpayers need to mandatorily declare all their foreign assets in the ITR, and that also includes investments in US stocks or assets in any other countries. If an individual has taxable income that is below the basic exemption limit of Rs 3 lakh but has stocks in foreign countries, he or she will still need to file the ITR to disclose the stock holdings.

Foreign stocks have to be declared in the ITR every year until the taxpayer has their name on it. In case of failure to declare the foreign stocks or any foreign asset like real estate, bank deposits, accounts, or insurance policies, the taxpayer will be liable to inspection by the tax department under the Black Money and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015. Besides the scrutiny, they can be penalised with up to Rs 10 lakh fine.

### Taxation for foreign investments and stocks

In India, when a foreign stock is sold after a term of two years, the profit earned from it is treated as long-term capital gains (LTCG) and is taxed at 20 percent (surcharge extra), with indexation benefit. While short-term capital gains (STCG) are taxed at the income slab rates. There is no tax liability on capital gains for the foreign-born.

Also, the dividend income earned on foreign investments is taxed at the pre-defined tax slab rates in India. In the US, when the dividend is paid, the government withholds a flat 25 percent as tax. India has a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) with the US, due to which one can claim the tax paid in the US to avoid the tax liability in India while filing the ITR.

## Taxes on house

- In respect of capital gains arising on sale any asset other than a residential house, an individual or an HUF can claim exemption from long term capital gains if the net sale consideration in respect of such asset is invested for acquiring a residential house within a period of two years after sale of such asset.
- Under Section 54F you should not own more than one residential house property on the date of sale of the asset except the one in respect of which you are claiming the exemption
- Purchase of the plot by you in your wife’s name will be treated as gift to your wife. As per the provisions of Section 64 of Income Tax Act, all the income arising on property gifted to your spouse is required to be added in your hands.
- Any gift given to a spouse is exempt from tax. However, if the spouse has no income and the gift is an income generating asset, the income from that asset may be clubbed with the income of the spouse who gifted the asset under clubbing provisions. If both husband and wife wish to claim tax benefit for their joint investments, they may have to enter into a simple agreement bifurcating proportionate ownership for housing loan repayment to reflect in their respective tax returns.

## Property Taxes

Property tax is calculated by the municipal authorities in proportion tothe assessed value of the property.There are mainly three ways of calculating property tax:

### Capital Value System (CVS)

The tax is levied as a percentage of the market value of the property. This market value is determined by the government and is based on the locality of the property. The market value is revised and published yearly. Mumbai follows this system.

### Annual Rental Value System or Rateable Value System (RVS)

Under this system, the tax is calculated on the yearly rental value of the property. This is not necessarily the actual rent amount being collected; rather it is the rental value decided by the municipal authority based on the size, location, condition of the premises, proximity to landmarks, amenities etc. Examples of municipalities following this system of property tax include Hyderabad and Chennai.

### Unit Area Value System (UAS)

In this system, the tax is levied on the per unit price of the built-up area of the property. This price is fixed (per square foot per month) based on the expected returns of the property as per its location, land price, and usage, and is then multiplied with its built-up area. Municipalities like Delhi, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Patna and Hyderabad follow this system for property tax calculation.
