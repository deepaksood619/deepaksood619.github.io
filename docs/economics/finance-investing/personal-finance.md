# Personal Finance

If you have to think about buying something then it means you cannot afford it! -- MJ DeMarco

## 4 pillars

#### Protection

Adequate life insurance (To ensure your dependants don't struggle in your absence), Health & accident insurance (To ensure the expenses don't cause a financial strain & portfolio drawdown). Emergency funds and possibly, a medical corpus.

#### Investments

Asset allocation, risk management, goal-based planning.... The usual gospel

#### Taxation

Minimizing the amount you pay to the taxman and the corresponding impact it has on your portfolio. Understanding the power of capital gains vs income tax

#### Administration

This is arguably the most important, and the most overlooked, pillar. It encapsulates a wide variety of actions ranging from financial tracking to the formation of a continuity plan (To ensure your dependants can continue in the case of your demise). Central to these is ensuring that wills are made, the right nominations have been selected/updated, and the sharing of important documents.
