Cubic zirconia is a man-made, lab-created gemstone that resembles a diamond. It is made of zirconium dioxide and is optically flawless. This means that it looks very similar to a natural diamond, but it is much more affordable. The stones are created in a laboratory, which makes them much less expensive than natural diamonds.
