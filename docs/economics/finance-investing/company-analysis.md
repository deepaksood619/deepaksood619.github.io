### My Take

#### Pros

- Don't have to go out, since road infra and traffic is very bad in India
- Can eat within the comfort of home
- Founder is good (yet to validate)

#### Cons

- Eating in India is now also very cheap locally then in big restaurants, since it's a huge unorganized market.
- Once you know which restaurants to eat from, you can order directly rather than through platform
- Cooking in home is much cheaper than eating outside
- Some foods are not good eating at home, than eating at restaurants (like tandoori roti, it gets dry)
