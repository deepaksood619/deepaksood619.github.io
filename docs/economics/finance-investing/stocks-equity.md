# Stocks / Equity

The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient - Warren Buffet

Selling stock is as important as buying stock

Don't sell the stocks which gives you high returns, sell the negative or no returns stock

Equity risk premium

Stocks are forward looking

### Taxes on ETF / Equity Mutual Funds

Long-term capital gains from the transfer of equity shares (listed and non-listed) or from stake sales in a startup can be avoided under section 54F of the Income Tax Act, 1961, if the gains are invested in residential property.

You can claim exemption against any long-term capital gains tax liability if you invest the net sale proceeds of such capital asset for buying a residential house within two years or get a residential house constructed within three years from the date of sale of such asset. One can claim this exemption even if you have already purchased a house within one year prior to sale of long-term capital gains asset.
