# Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) / Retirement

FIRE means to save and invest aggressively in your 20s and 30s so that you can live the latter years of your life freely

FIRE has more to do with your current lifestyle. To implement FIRE, you save and invest up to 50-70% of your income in assets that can generate high returns and passive income.

Enough will never be enough

## Types

### Lean FIRE

Saving up to 25x their annual expenses and adhere to a strict budget.

- Generates just enough passive income to fulfil basic needs
- Builds the habit of a simple lifestyle
- Can be a stepping stone for more comprehensive FIRE lifestyles

### Fat FIRE

Large post-retirement budget with investments that can produce aggressive returns and passive income.

- Extravagant lifestyle planning
- Secures financial futures of dependants
- Accounts for bigger financial emergencies

### Barista FIRE

A combination of Lean and Fat FIRE, this one involves getting a part-time job after retiring early to fund post-retirement expenses.

- Part-time income reduces stress and enables the gathering of a large corpus
- Does not require you to sacrifice your lifestyle as much.

### Coast FIRE

Retiring with a part-time job and minimal post-retirement corpus

- Choicest lifestyle, but with an eye on the future.
- Opportunity to go back to full-time employment in case you exhaust your F.I.R.E budget due to unforeseen circumstances

## Lifestyle upgrades

- 2 objectives that contradict each other, one objective is to achieve financial independence, other objective is to have lifestyle upgrade
- Move from 2 wheeler, to AC car, to SUV to german brand car, bigger homes, etc
- Keep the lifestyle upgrade urge in check, and not let it run away too much because then your target itself keeps moving up, which can hamper financial independence

## Finance Gratitude

- **Entitlement**

rags to riches and back to rags stories of film stars, lottery ticket winners, and such other starkly high income earners who lost their wealth.

They would be surrounded by relatives and friends that systematically leached off the wealth or led them to poor quality investments. The man who won the first round of Kaun Banega Crorepati admitted that he bought houses for siblings and funded their businesses before losing his winnings and returning to his old job in a few years. Easy money belongs to everyone - that seems to be the credo.

- Do not disclose your earnings, income or wealth. No one other than your spouse and children at an appropriate age need to know. What you give is always measured with respect to what you make. In itself, a gift of 50,000 at a relative's wedding is substantial. It might be bigger than what others gave. But if it is known that you earn Rs. 5 lakh every month, that is seen as too little.

- Keep control and equity about who will receive your charities. Someone is not ahead of the queue only because they are related to you or your spouse. You make the decision because it is your money and you know who deserves it. Putting a dozen poor children through college is better than enabling a sibling to upgrade their car. You don't have to justify that decision.

- Money given away to those around you who behave with a sense of entitlement, is almost never returned. You mostly lose the money and the relationship if you asked. Earmark an amount you can afford to write off. Limit your commitment to that amount and no more.

- Do not respond to a request for funds with an immediate yes or no. The yes will be seen as too willing; the no will be seen as too rude. Try a response like: let me think about this and come back to you. That gives you the time and those that were taking a shot at asking may not come back. Just as we do not invest in a do-it-right-now investment option, giving also need not be an immediate response.

- Do not try to use your money to buy friendships and relationships. A very common mistake that the moneyed make is to use the power of their wealth to be surrounded by followers and ego massaging yes men. These are poor investments. None of these last when your money is gone. You are aware of your importance in the family due to your wealth; learn to use it wisely.

- Make rules that indicate how you will decide whom to support. Keep it equitable between both spouses. Discuss how you will support both parents; how you will contribute to old age support and hospitalizations; and so on. Identify specific causes like education and the limits you will go towards funding it. Allocate a percentage of your earnings and be gracious about it to the outside world, but clear and rule based within the household.

## Time vs Money Rich

You can either be TIME rich or you can be MONEY rich. But, smart people are both.

1. I'm sure you know people, who are super busy all the time. They have no time for their family, friends or even their own children.
	1. It is okay to have this type of a lifestyle for a brief period of your life. But, if this becomes a habit, then you need to acknowledge the problem that you are time poor.
	2. Use your money to create time: delegate, build passive sources of income and learn to invest.
2. You might have also met people who have a lot of free time. And, they are super stressed that they don't make enough money.
	1. NO, you are already time rich.
	2. Now you just need to figure out how to convert your time to money.
	3. Invest your time: learning new skills, experimenting with ideas and networking with folks would go a long way in terms of helping you out.
3. Smart folks: switch between using their money to buy time. And, using their time to build money.
