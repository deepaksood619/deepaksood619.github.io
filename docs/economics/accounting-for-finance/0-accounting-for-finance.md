[Accounting 101 (taught by a non-accountant)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUkh9m2BorqmKaLrNBjKtFDhpdFdi8f7C)

This is a course of short webcasts (about 12-20 minutes apiece), designed to introduce you to the basics of accounting, but more from the perspective of a user of financial statements than from someone who cares about accounting rules and standards. So, be forewarned! I have no qualms about saying terrible things about accounting standards and rule writers, rewriting accounting rules to fit my perspectives on valuation and corporate finance, and ignoring vast segments of accounting statements as useless in financial analysis.

### Revenue vs Margin

- Buying Price - 50000
- Selling Price - 75000

#### 1. Calculation 1

(75000-5000)/50000 = 50%

- Here, the denominator is **50000**.
- This formula calculates the **markup on cost (markup percentage)**.
- It answers: "**How much profit is being made as a percentage of the cost?**"
- **Name**: **Markup Percentage**

#### 2. Calculation 2

(75000-5000)/75000 = 33%

- Here, the denominator is **75000**.
- This formula calculates the **profit margin** or **gross margin percentage**.
- It answers: "**What portion of the revenue is profit?**"
- **Name**: **Profit Margin Percentage**

#### Key Difference

- **Markup Percentage** is based on **cost** (how much you add on top of cost).
- **Profit Margin Percentage** is based on **revenue** (how much of the revenue is profit).
- **Markup is always higher than profit margin** for the same numbers.

### Why businesses uses profit margin rather than markup for comparing companies?

Businesses and investors use **profit margin** rather than **markup** when comparing companies because **profit margin is a standardized measure of profitability**, whereas markup varies based on cost structures. Here’s why:

#### 1. Profit Margin is Relative to Revenue (Apples-to-Apples Comparison)

- **Profit Margin = Profit / Revenue** → It tells how much of the revenue is actual profit.
- Since revenue is a standard metric across industries, companies of different sizes and business models can be compared fairly.
- Example: A company with a **20% profit margin** means it retains **₹20 profit for every ₹100 in revenue**, regardless of cost structures.

#### 2. Markup is Based on Cost (Not Always Comparable)

- **Markup = Profit / Cost** → It tells how much extra is added over cost.
- Cost structures vary significantly across industries, making markup a poor comparison tool.
- Example: A software company may have low costs but high markup, whereas a manufacturing company may have higher costs and a lower markup.

#### 3. Investors & Analysts Use Profit Margins for Decision-Making

- **Gross Profit Margin, Operating Margin, and Net Profit Margin** are key financial indicators in earnings reports.
- Investors compare profit margins to assess efficiency, profitability, and risk.
- Example: If Company A has a **40% gross margin** and Company B has **25%**, Company A is likely more efficient at turning revenue into profit.

#### 4. Profit Margins Reflect Business Health & Strategy

- Companies with similar markups can have different profit margins due to operational costs, overhead, and pricing strategies.
- Profit margin accounts for **all costs and revenue**, giving a clearer picture of financial health.

#### Summary

- **Profit margin** is used for **comparing businesses across industries** because it’s based on revenue and reflects overall profitability.
- **Markup** is useful for **internal pricing strategies** but not for comparing companies with different cost structures.
