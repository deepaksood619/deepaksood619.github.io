#### What is the disclosed quantity feature and how to use it?

Disclosed quantity feature while placing equity orders allows only a part of the total order quantity to be disclosed to the market as shown in the market depth. Once a part of the order is executed, the next part is disclosed to the market. This feature can be used while placing large orders to reduce impact cost and to get a better execution by disclosing only a portion of the large order in the best bids and offers in the market depth.
