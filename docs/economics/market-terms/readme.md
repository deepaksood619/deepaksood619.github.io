## DEMAT - Dematerialization

Before 1996 the share certificate was in paper format however post 1996, the share certificates were converted to digital form. The process of converting a paper format share certificate into a digital format share certificate is called "Dematerialization" often abbreviated as DEMAT.

At present, there are only two depositaries offering you DEMAT account services. They are The National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) and Central Depository Services (India) Limited. There is virtually no difference between the two and both of them operate under strict SEBI regulations.

Just like the way you cannot walk into National Stock Exchange's office to open a trading account, you cannot walk into a Depository to open a DEMAT account. To open a DEMAT account you need to liaison with a Depository Participant (DP). A DP helps you set up your DEMAT account with a Depository. A DP acts as an agent to the Depository. Needless to say, even the DP is governed by the regulations laid out by the SEBI.

## NSCCL and ICCL

NSCCL -- National Security Clearing Corporation Ltd and Indian Clearing Corporation are wholly owned subsidiaries of National Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange respectively.

The job of the clearing corporation is to ensure guaranteed settlement of your trades/transactions. For example, if you were to buy 1 share of Biocon at Rs.446 per share there must be someone who has sold that 1 share to you at Rs.446 . For this transaction, you will be debited Rs.446 from your trading account and someone must be credited that Rs.446 toward the sale of Biocon. In a typical transaction like this the clearing corporation's role is to ensure the following:

a) Identify the buyer and seller and match the debit and credit process

b) Ensure no defaults -- The clearing corporation also ensures there are no defaults by either party. For instance the seller after selling the shares should not be in a position to back out thereby defaulting in his transaction.

## Trader

A trader is a person who spots an opportunity and initiates the trade with an expectation of profitably exiting the trade at the earliest given opportunity. A trader usually has a short term view on markets. A trader is alert and on his toes during market hours constantly evaluating opportunities based on risk and reward. He is unbiased toward going long or going short. We will discuss what going long or short means at a later stage.

## There are different types of traders

- Day Trader-- A day trader initiates and closes the position during the day. He does not carry forward his positions. He is risk averse and does not like taking overnight risk. For example -- He would buy 100 shares of TCS at 2212 at 9:15AM and sell it at 2220 at 3:20 PM making a profit of Rs.800/- in this trade. A day trader usually trades 5 to 6 stocks per day.

- Scalper-- A type of a day trader. He usually trades very large quantities of shares and holds the stock for very less time with an intention to make a small but quick profit. For example -- He would buy 10,000 shares of TCS as 2212 at 9:15 and sell it 2212.1 at 9.16. He ends up making 1000/- profit in this trade. In a typical day, he would have placed many such trades. As you may have noticed a scalp trader is highly risk averse.

- Swing Trader-- A swing trader holds on to his trade for slightly longer time duration, the duration can run into anywhere between few days to weeks. He is typically more open to taking risks. For example -- He would buy 100 shares of TCS at 2212 on 12thJune 2014 and sell it 2214 on 19thJune 2014.

Some of the really successful traders the world has seen are -- George Soros, Ed Seykota, Paul Tudor, Micheal Steinhardt, Van K Tharp, Stanley Druckenmiller etc

## Scalper

[Scalpers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scalpers.asp) are a specific type of short-term trader that may dart in and out of a stock or other [asset class](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetclasses.asp) dozens, or in some cases even hundreds, of times a day.

- Scalpers are often high-energy individuals who thrive during times of stress and have the means and temperament to handle the high trading volume.
- Most often, because scalping requires considerable time, money, and skill, scalpers are professional traders.

## Investor

An investor is a person who buys a stock expecting a significant appreciation in the stock. He is willing to wait for his investment to evolve. The typical holding period of investors usually runs into a few years. There are two popular types of investors..

- Growth Investors-- The objective here is to identify companies which are expected to grow significantly because of emerging industry and macro trends. A classic example in the Indian context would be buying Hindustan Unilever, Infosys, Gillette India back in 1990s. These companies witnessed huge growth because of the change in the industry landscape thereby creating massive wealth for its shareholders.

- Value Investors-- The objective here is to identify good companies irrespective of whether they are in growth phase or mature phase but beaten down significantly due to the short term market sentiment thereby making a great value buy. An example of this in recent times is L&T. Due to short term negative sentiment; L&T was beaten down significantly around August/September of 2013. The stock price collapsed to 690 all the way from 1200. At 690 (given its fundamentals around Aug 2013), a company like L&T is perceived as cheap, and therefore a great value pick. Eventually it did pay off, as the stock price scaled back to 1440 around May 2014.

https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/supplementary-note-the-20-market-depth

## Types of Markets

- Bull market
- Bear market
- Recovering market
- Market crashes
- Side ways market

## Bull Market (Bullish)

If you believe that the stock prices are likely to go up then you are said to be bullish on the stock price. From a broader perspective, if the stock market index is going up during a particular time period, then it is referred to as the bull market

## Bear Market (Bearish)

If you believe that the stock prices are likely to go down then you are said to be bearish on the stock price. From a broader perspective, if the stock market index is going down during a particular time period, then it is referred to as the bear market

## Trend

The term 'trend' usually refers to the general market direction, and its associated strength. For example, if the market is declining fast, the trend is said to be bearish. If the market is trading flat with no movement then the trend is said to be sideways

## Face value of a stock

Face value (FV) or par value of a stock indicates the fixed denomination of a share. The face value is important with regard to a corporate action. Usually, when dividends and stock split are announced they are issued keeping the face value in perspective. For example, the FV of Infosys is 5, and if they announce an annual dividend of Rs.63/- then it means the dividend paid is 1260%s (63 divided by 5)

## 52 week high/low

52 week high is the highest point at which a stock has traded during the last 52 weeks (which also marks a year) and likewise 52 week low marks the lowest point at which the stock has traded during the last 52 weeks. The 52 week high and low gives a sense of the range within which the stock has traded during the year. Many people believe that if a stock reaches 52 week high, then it indicates a bullish trend for the foreseeable future. Similarly, if a stock hits 52 week low, some traders believe that it indicates a bearish trend for a foreseeable future

## All-time high/low

This is similar to the 52 week high and low, with the only difference being the all-time high price is the highest price the stock has ever traded from the time it has been listed. Similarly, the all-time low price is the lowest price at which the stock has ever traded from the time it has been listed

## Upper Circuit/Lower Circuit

The exchange sets up a price band at which the stock can be traded in the market on a given trading day. The highest price the stock can reach on the day is the upper circuit limit and the lowest price is the lower circuit limit. The limit for a stock is set to 2%, 5%, 10% or 20% based on the exchange's selection criteria. The exchange places these restrictions to control excessive volatility when a stock reacts to certain news related to the company

## Long Position

Long position or going long is simply a reference to the direction of your trade. For example, if you have bought or intend to buy Biocon shares then you are said to be long on Biocon or planning to go long on Biocon respectively. If you have bought the Nifty Index with an expectation that the index will trade higher then essentially you have a long position on Nifty. If you are long on a stock or an index, you are said to be bullish

## Short Position

Going short or simply 'shorting' is a term used to describe a transaction carried out in a particular order. This is a slightly tricky concept

The concept of shorting is very counter-intuitive simply because we are not used to 'shorting' in our day to day activity unless you have a trader mentality 🙂

Going back to stock markets, think about this very simple transaction -- on day 1 you buy shares of Wipro at Rs.405, two days later (day 3) the stock moves and you sell your shares at Rs.425. You made a profit of Rs.20/- on this transaction.

In this transaction, your first leg of the trade was to buy Wipro at Rs.405, and the second leg was to sell Wipro at Rs.425, and you were bullish on the stock.

Going forward, on day 4, the stock is still trading at Rs.425, and you are now bearish on the stock. You are convinced that the stock will trade lower at Rs.405 in a few days' time. Now, is there a way you can profit out of your bearish expectation? Well, you could, and it can be done so by shorting the stock.

You sell the stock at Rs.425, and 2 days later assuming the stock trades at Rs.405, you buy it back.

If you realize the first leg of the trade was to sell at Rs.425, and the second leg was to buy the stock at Rs.405. This is always the case with shorting -- you first sell at a price you perceive as high with the intention of buying it back at a lower price at a later point in time.

You have actually executed the same trade as buying at Rs.405 and selling at Rs.425 but in reverse order.

An obvious question you may have -- How can one sell Wipro shares without owning it. Well, you can do so, just like the way I sold a phone that I did not own.

When you first sell, you are essentially borrowing it from someone else in the market, and when you buy it back, you actually return the shares back. All this happens in the backend, and the stock exchange facilitates the process of borrowing and returning it back.

In fact, when you short a stock, it works so seamlessly that you will not even realize that you are borrowing it from someone else. From your perspective, all you need to know is that when you are bearish on the stock, you can short the stock, and the exchange takes care of borrowing the stock on your behalf. When you buy the stocks back, the exchange will ensure the stocks are returned back.

When you short, you have a bearish view on the stock. You profit if the stock price goes down. After you short, if the stock price goes up, you will end up making a loss

When you short you essentially borrow from another market participant, and you will have to deliver these shares back. You need not worry about the mechanics of this. The system will ensure all this happens in the background

Shorting a stock is easy -- either you call your broker and ask him to short the stock or you do it yourself by selecting the stock you wish to short, and click on sell

For all practical purposes, if you want to short a stock, and hold the position for few days, it is best done on the derivatives markets

When you are short, you make money when the stock price goes down. You will make a loss if the stock price goes up after you have shorted the stock.

To summarize long and short positions...

## Square off

Square off is a term used to indicate that you intend to close an existing position. If you are long on a stock squaring off the position means to sell the stock. Please remember, when you are selling the stock to close an existing long position you are not shorting the stock

When you are short on the stock, squaring off a position means to buy the stock back. Remember when you buy it back, you are just closing an existing position and you are not going long!

When you areSquare off position is

LongSell the stock

ShortBuy the stock

Intraday position -- This is a trading position you initiate with an expectation to square off the position within the same day.

## Short Covering

Short covering refers to buying back borrowed securities in order to close out an open short position at a profit or loss. It requires purchasing the same security that was initially [sold short](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp), and handing back the shares initially borrowed for the short sale. This type of transaction is referred to as [buy to cover](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buytocover.asp).

- Short covering can result in either a profit (if the asset is repurchased lower than where it was sold) or for a loss (if it is higher).
- Short covering may be forced if there is a short squeeze and sellers become subject to margin calls. Measures of short interest can help predict the chances of a squeeze.

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortcovering.asp

## Short Squeeze

A short squeeze is an unusual condition that triggers rapidly rising prices in a stock or other tradable security. For a short squeeze to occur, the [security](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp) must have an unusual degree of short sellers holding positions in it. The short squeeze begins when the price jumps higher unexpectedly. The condition plays out as a significant measure of the short sellers coincidentally decide to cut losses and exit their positions.

- A short squeeze accelerates a stock's price rise as short sellers bail out to cut their losses.
- Contrarian investors try to anticipate a short squeeze and buy stocks that demonstrate a strong short interest.
- Both short sellers and contrarians make risky moves. A wise investor has additional reasons for shorting or buying that stock.

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp

https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/050715/what-difference-between-short-squeeze-and-short-covering.asp

"Short covering" and "short squeeze" are different terms to describe a situation involving short positions. A short squeeze is a situation in which a security's price increases significantly, causing short sellers to close their short positions. Conversely, short covering involves buying back a security to close out an open short position.

## Volume

Volumes and its impact on the stock prices is an important concept that we will explore in greater detail in the technical analysis module. Volumes represent the total transactions (both buy and sell put together) for a particular stock on a particular day. For example, on 17th June 2014, the volume on ACC was 5, 33,819 shares

## Market Segment

A market segment is a division within which a certain type of financial instrument is traded. Each financial instrument is characterized by its risk and reward parameters. The exchange operates in three main segments

1. **Capital Market --** Capital market segments offer a wide range of tradable securities such as equity, preference shares, warrants, and exchange-traded funds. Capital Market segment has sub-segments under which instruments are further classified. For example, common shares of companies are traded under the equity segment abbreviated as EQ. So if you were to buy or sell shares of a company you are essentially operating in the capital market segment

2. **Futures and Options (F&O) --** Futures and Option, generally referred to as the equity derivative segment is where one would trade leveraged products. We will explore the derivative markets in greater depth in the derivatives module

3. **Wholesale Debt Market --** The wholesale debt market deals with fixed income securities. Debt instruments include government securities, treasury bills, bonds issued by a public sector undertaking, corporate bonds, corporate debentures, etc.

- MIS - Margin Intraday Settlement
- CNC - Cash and Carry

Select CNC for delivery trades. Meaning if your intention is to buy and hold the shares for multiple days/months/years then you need to ensure the shares reside in your Demat account. Selecting CNC is your way of communicating this to your broker.

Select NRML or MIS if you want to trade intraday. MIS is a margin product;

Buy Today, Sell Tomorrow" (BTST) or "Acquire Today, Sell Tomorrow" (ATST)

## OHLC - Open (O), high (H), low (L), and close (C)

OHLC stands for open, high, low and close. We will understand more about this in the technical analysis module. For now, open is the price at which the stock opens for the day, high is the highest price at which the stock trade during the day, low is the lowest price at which the stock trades during the day and the close is the closing price of the stock. For example, the OHLC of ACC on 17th June 2014 was 1486, 1511, 1467 and 1499.

The **Last traded price (LTP)** usually differs from the **closing price** of the day. This because theclosing priceof the day on NSE is the weighted averagepriceof the last 30 mins of trading. Last tradedpriceof the day is the actual last tradedprice.

## Carry Forex / Carry Trade

A currency carry trade is a strategy whereby a high-yielding currency funds the trade with a low-yielding currency. A trader using this strategy attempts to capture the difference between the rates, which can often be substantial, depending on the amount of leverage used.

The carry trade is one of the most popular trading strategies in the forex market. The most popular carry trades have involved buying currency pairs like the Australian dollar/Japanese yen and New Zealand dollar/Japanese yen because the interest rate spreads of these currency pairs have been quite high. The first step in putting together a carry trade is to find out which currency offers a high yield and which one offers a low yield.

## New Fund Offer (NFO)

A New Fund Offer (NFO) refers to the introductory offer of a scheme by an [asset management company](https://www.paisabazaar.com/mutual-funds/asset-management-company/). A New fund offer is raised when a fund is launched, which helps the firm raise capital for purchasing securities. An investor can subscribe to an NFO only within a limited time period; hence, NFOs are functional on first-come-first serve basis.

## Types of NFO

- [Open-ended funds](https://www.paisabazaar.com/mutual-funds/open-ended-funds/): This fund is officially launched after the NFO ends. Investors can enter and exit the fund at any time after the launch.
- Close-ended funds: A [close-ended fund](https://www.paisabazaar.com/mutual-funds/closed-end-funds/) does not allow the entry and/or exit of investors after the NFO period, until its maturity. This time period is typically 3-4 years from the launch date. However, the investors may buy and sell the units of such a fund on the stock market in theory, but the liquidity of such funds on the market tends to be low.

## SAFE Note - Simple Aggrement for Future Equity

SAFE (simple agreement for future equity) notes are a simpler alternative to [convertible notes](https://www.upcounsel.com/convertible-notes). They were created in 2013 by Y Combinator, a Silicon Valley accelerator, and allow startups to structure seed investments without interest rates or maturity dates. SAFEs are short five-page documents. The valuation caps are the only negotiable detail.

A SAFE note is a convertible security that, like an option or warrant, allows the investor to buy shares in a future priced round. It addresses many of the drawbacks and challenges posed by convertible notes and can be an equitable option for investors and [founders](https://www.upcounsel.com/blog/the-one-thing-that-every-new-entrepreneur-should-know). Startups may prefer SAFE notes because, unlike convertible notes, they are not debt and therefore do not accrue interest.
