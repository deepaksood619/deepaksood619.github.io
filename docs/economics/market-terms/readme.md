## Stock Market

Investing ensures financial security, and the Stock market plays a pivotal role in this domain, it is a place where people buy/sell shares of publicly listed companies. In this module, you will learn about the fundamentals of the stock market, how to get started, how it functions and the various intermediaries that appertain it.

## Stock Market Participants

1. Domestic Retail Participants-- These are people like you and me transacting in markets

2. NRI's and OCI-- These are people of Indian origin but based outside India

3. Domestic Institutions-- These are large corporate entities based in India. A classic example would be the LIC of India.

4. Domestic Asset Management Companies (AMC)-- Typical participants in this category would be the mutual fund companies such as SBI Mutual Fund, DSP Black Rock, Fidelity Investments, HDFC AMC, etc.

5. Foreign Institutional Investors-- Non-Indian corporate entities. These could be foreign asset management companies, hedge funds, and other investors

## SEBI (The Securities and Exchange Board of India)

1. The stock exchanges (BSE and NSE) conducts its business fairly
2. Stockbrokers and sub-brokers conduct their business fairly
3. Participants don't get involved in unfair practices
4. Corporate's don't use the markets to unduly benefit themselves (Example -- Satyam Computers)
5. Small retail investors interests are protected
6. Large investors with huge cash pile should not manipulate the markets
7. An overall development of markets

| **Entity** | **Example of companies** | **What do they do?** | **In simpler words** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Credit Rating Agency (CRA)** | CRISIL, ICRA, CARE | They rate the credit worthiness of corporate and governments | If a corporate or Govt entity wants to avail loan, CRA checks if the entity is worthy of giving a loan |
| **Debenture Trustees** | Almost all banks in India | Act as a trustee to corporate debenture | When companies want to raise a loan they can issue debenture against which they promise to pay an interest. These debentures can be subscribed by public. A Debenture Trustee ensures that the debenture obligation is honored |
| **Depositories** | NSDL and CDSL | Safekeeping, reporting and settlement of clients securities | Acts like a vault for the shares that you buy. The depositories hold your shares and facilitate exchange of your securities. When you buy shares these shares sit in your Depositary account usually referred to as the DEMAT account. This is maintained electronically by only two companies in India |
| **Depositary Participant (DP)** | Most of the banks and few stock brokers | Act as an agent to the two depositories | You cannot directly interact with NSDL or CDSL. You need to liaison with a DP to open and maintain your DEMAT account |
| **Foreign Institutional Investors** | Foreign corporate, funds and individuals | Make investments in India | These are foreign entities with an interest to invest in India. They usually transact in large amounts of money, and hence their activity in the markets have an impact in terms of market sentiment |
| **Merchant Bankers** | Karvy, Axis Bank, Edelweiss Capital | Help companies raise money in the primary markets | If a company plans to raise money by floating an IPO, then merchant bankers are the ones who help companies with the IPO process |
| **Asset Management Companies
(AMC)** | HDFC AMC, Reliance Capital, SBI Capital | Offer Mutual Fund Schemes | An AMC collects money from the public, puts that money in a single account and then invests that money in markets with an objective of making the investments grow and thereby generate wealth to its investors. |
| **Portfolio Managers/
Portfolio Management System
(PMS)** | Religare Wealth Management, Parag Parikh PMS | Offer PMS schemes | They work similarly to a mutual fund except in a PMS you have to invest a minimum of Rs.25,00,000 however there is no such cap in a mutual fund |
| **Stock Brokers and Sub Brokers** | Zerodha, Sharekhan, ICICI Direct | Act as a intermediary between an investor and the stock exchange | Whenever you want to buy or sell shares from the stock exchange you have to do so through registered stock brokers. A sub broker is like an agent to a stock broker |

## DEMAT - Dematerialization

Before 1996 the share certificate was in paper format however post 1996, the share certificates were converted to digital form. The process of converting a paper format share certificate into a digital format share certificate is called "Dematerialization" often abbreviated as DEMAT.

At present, there are only two depositaries offering you DEMAT account services. They are The National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) and Central Depository Services (India) Limited. There is virtually no difference between the two and both of them operate under strict SEBI regulations.

Just like the way you cannot walk into National Stock Exchange's office to open a trading account, you cannot walk into a Depository to open a DEMAT account. To open a DEMAT account you need to liaison with a Depository Participant (DP). A DP helps you set up your DEMAT account with a Depository. A DP acts as an agent to the Depository. Needless to say, even the DP is governed by the regulations laid out by the SEBI.

## NSCCL and ICCL

NSCCL -- National Security Clearing Corporation Ltd and Indian Clearing Corporation are wholly owned subsidiaries of National Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange respectively.

The job of the clearing corporation is to ensure guaranteed settlement of your trades/transactions. For example, if you were to buy 1 share of Biocon at Rs.446 per share there must be someone who has sold that 1 share to you at Rs.446 . For this transaction, you will be debited Rs.446 from your trading account and someone must be credited that Rs.446 toward the sale of Biocon. In a typical transaction like this the clearing corporation's role is to ensure the following:

a) Identify the buyer and seller and match the debit and credit process

b) Ensure no defaults -- The clearing corporation also ensures there are no defaults by either party. For instance the seller after selling the shares should not be in a position to back out thereby defaulting in his transaction.

1. Before understanding why companies go public, it is important to understand the origin of business
2. The people who invest in your business in the pre-revenue stage are called Angel Investors
3. Angel investors take the maximum risk. They take in as much risk as the promoter
4. The money that angels give to start the business is called the seed fund
5. Angel's invest relatively a small amount of capital
6. Valuation of a company simply signifies how much the company is valued at. When one values the company they consider the company's assets and liabilities
7. Face value is simply a denominator to indicate how much one share is originally worth
8. Authorized shares of the company are the total number of shares that are available with the company
9. The shares distributed from the authorized shares are called the issued shares. Issued shares are always a subset of authorized shares.
10. The shareholding pattern of a company tells us who owns how much stake in the company
11. Venture Capitalists invest at an early stage in business; they do not take as much risk as Angel investors. The quantum of investments by a VC is usually somewhere in between an angel and private equity investment
12. The money the company spends on business expansion is called capital expenditure or CAPEX
13. Series A, B, and C, etc are all funding that the company seeks as they start evolving. Usually higher the series, higher is the investment required.
14. Beyond a certain size, VCs cannot invest, and hence the company seeking investments will have to approach Private Equity firms
15. PE firms invest large sums of money and they usually invest at a slightly more mature stage of the business
16. In terms of risk, PE's have a lower risk appetite as compared to VC or angels
17. Typical PE investors would like to deploy their own people on the board of the investee company to ensure business moves in the right direction
18. The valuation of the company increases as and when the business , revenues and profitability increases
19. An IPO is a process by means of which a company can raise fund. The funds raised can be for any valid reason -- for CAPEX, restructuring debt, rewarding shareholders, etc

## IPO sequence of events

- **Appoint a merchant banker -** In case of a large public issue, the company can appoint more than 1 merchant banker
- **Apply to SEBI with a registration statement--** The registration statement contains details on what the company does, why the company plans to go public and the financial health of the company
- **Getting a nod from SEBI**-- Once SEBI receives the registration statement, SEBI takes a call on whether to issue a go-ahead or a 'no go' to the IPO
- **DRHP**-- If the company gets the initial SEBI nod, then the company needs to prepare the DRHP. A DRHP is a document that gets circulated to the public. Along with a lot of information, DRHP should contain the following details:

  - The estimated size of the IPO

  - The estimated number of shares being offered to the public

  - Why the company wants to go public and how does the company plan to utilize the funds along with the timeline projection of fund utilization

  - Business description including the revenue model, expenditure details

  - Complete financial statements

  - Management Discussion and Analysis -- how the company perceives future business operations to emerge

  - Risks involved in the business

  - Management details and their background
- **Market the IPO**-- This would involve TV and print advertisements in order to build awareness about the company and its IPO offering. This process is also called the IPO roadshow
- **Fix the price band**-- Decide the price band between which the company would like to go public. Of course, this can't be way off the general perception. If it is, then the public will not subscribe for the IPO
- **Book Building**-- Once the roadshow is done and the price band fixed the company now has to officially open the window during which the public can subscribe for shares. For example, if the price band is between Rs.100 and Rs.120, then the public can actually choose a price they think is fair enough for the IPO issue. The process of collecting all these price points along with the respective quantities is called Book Building. Book building is perceived as an effective price discovery method
- **Closure**-- After the book building window is closed (generally open for few days) then the price point at which the issue gets listed is decided. This price point is usually the price at which maximum bids have been received.
- **Listing Day--** This is the day when the company actually gets listed on the stock exchange. The listing price is the price decided based on market demand and supply on that day and the stock is listed at a premium, par or discount of the cut-off price

## What happens after the IPO?

During the bidding process (also called the date of issue) investors can bid for shares at a particular price within the specified price band. This whole system around the date of the issue where one bids for shares, is referred to as thePrimary Market. The moment the stock gets listed and debuts on the stock exchange, the stock starts to trade publicly. This is called thesecondary market.

Once the stock transitions from primary markets to secondary markets, the stock gets traded daily on the stock exchange. People start buying and selling stocks regularly.

## Few key IPO jargons

**Under subscription** - Let's say the company wants to offer 100,000 shares to the public. During the book-building process, it is discovered that only 90,000 bids were received, then the issue is said to be under subscribed. This is not a great situation to be in as it indicates negative public sentiment

**Oversubscription** - If there are 200,000 bids for 100,000 shares on offer then the issue is said to be oversubscribed 2 times (2x)

**Green Shoe Option** -Part of the underwriting agreement which allows the issuer to authorize additional shares (typically 15 percent) to be distributed in the event of oversubscription. This is also called the overallotment option

**Fixed Price IPO** - Sometimes the companies fix the price of the IPO and do not opt for a price band. Such issues are called fixed price IPO

**Price Band and Cut off price** - Price band is a price range between which the stock gets listed. For example, if the price band is between Rs.100 and Rs.130, then the issue can list within the range. Let's says it gets listed at 125, then 125 is called the cut off price

OFS - Offer For Sale

FPO - Follow-on Public Offer (Further Public Offer)

## Trader

A trader is a person who spots an opportunity and initiates the trade with an expectation of profitably exiting the trade at the earliest given opportunity. A trader usually has a short term view on markets. A trader is alert and on his toes during market hours constantly evaluating opportunities based on risk and reward. He is unbiased toward going long or going short. We will discuss what going long or short means at a later stage.

## There are different types of traders

- Day Trader-- A day trader initiates and closes the position during the day. He does not carry forward his positions. He is risk averse and does not like taking overnight risk. For example -- He would buy 100 shares of TCS at 2212 at 9:15AM and sell it at 2220 at 3:20 PM making a profit of Rs.800/- in this trade. A day trader usually trades 5 to 6 stocks per day.

- Scalper-- A type of a day trader. He usually trades very large quantities of shares and holds the stock for very less time with an intention to make a small but quick profit. For example -- He would buy 10,000 shares of TCS as 2212 at 9:15 and sell it 2212.1 at 9.16. He ends up making 1000/- profit in this trade. In a typical day, he would have placed many such trades. As you may have noticed a scalp trader is highly risk averse.

- Swing Trader-- A swing trader holds on to his trade for slightly longer time duration, the duration can run into anywhere between few days to weeks. He is typically more open to taking risks. For example -- He would buy 100 shares of TCS at 2212 on 12thJune 2014 and sell it 2214 on 19thJune 2014.

Some of the really successful traders the world has seen are -- George Soros, Ed Seykota, Paul Tudor, Micheal Steinhardt, Van K Tharp, Stanley Druckenmiller etc

## Scalper

[Scalpers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scalpers.asp) are a specific type of short-term trader that may dart in and out of a stock or other [asset class](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetclasses.asp) dozens, or in some cases even hundreds, of times a day.

- Scalpers are often high-energy individuals who thrive during times of stress and have the means and temperament to handle the high trading volume.
- Most often, because scalping requires considerable time, money, and skill, scalpers are professional traders.

## Investor

An investor is a person who buys a stock expecting a significant appreciation in the stock. He is willing to wait for his investment to evolve. The typical holding period of investors usually runs into a few years. There are two popular types of investors..

- Growth Investors-- The objective here is to identify companies which are expected to grow significantly because of emerging industry and macro trends. A classic example in the Indian context would be buying Hindustan Unilever, Infosys, Gillette India back in 1990s. These companies witnessed huge growth because of the change in the industry landscape thereby creating massive wealth for its shareholders.

- Value Investors-- The objective here is to identify good companies irrespective of whether they are in growth phase or mature phase but beaten down significantly due to the short term market sentiment thereby making a great value buy. An example of this in recent times is L&T. Due to short term negative sentiment; L&T was beaten down significantly around August/September of 2013. The stock price collapsed to 690 all the way from 1200. At 690 (given its fundamentals around Aug 2013), a company like L&T is perceived as cheap, and therefore a great value pick. Eventually it did pay off, as the stock price scaled back to 1440 around May 2014.

<https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/supplementary-note-the-20-market-depth>

## Types of Markets

- Bull market
- Bear market
- Recovering market
- Market crashes
- Side ways market

## Bull Market (Bullish)

If you believe that the stock prices are likely to go up then you are said to be bullish on the stock price. From a broader perspective, if the stock market index is going up during a particular time period, then it is referred to as the bull market

## Bear Market (Bearish)

If you believe that the stock prices are likely to go down then you are said to be bearish on the stock price. From a broader perspective, if the stock market index is going down during a particular time period, then it is referred to as the bear market

## Trend

The term 'trend' usually refers to the general market direction, and its associated strength. For example, if the market is declining fast, the trend is said to be bearish. If the market is trading flat with no movement then the trend is said to be sideways

## Face value of a stock

Face value (FV) or par value of a stock indicates the fixed denomination of a share. The face value is important with regard to a corporate action. Usually, when dividends and stock split are announced they are issued keeping the face value in perspective. For example, the FV of Infosys is 5, and if they announce an annual dividend of Rs.63/- then it means the dividend paid is 1260%s (63 divided by 5)

## 52 week high/low

52 week high is the highest point at which a stock has traded during the last 52 weeks (which also marks a year) and likewise 52 week low marks the lowest point at which the stock has traded during the last 52 weeks. The 52 week high and low gives a sense of the range within which the stock has traded during the year. Many people believe that if a stock reaches 52 week high, then it indicates a bullish trend for the foreseeable future. Similarly, if a stock hits 52 week low, some traders believe that it indicates a bearish trend for a foreseeable future

## All-time high/low

This is similar to the 52 week high and low, with the only difference being the all-time high price is the highest price the stock has ever traded from the time it has been listed. Similarly, the all-time low price is the lowest price at which the stock has ever traded from the time it has been listed

## Upper Circuit/Lower Circuit

The exchange sets up a price band at which the stock can be traded in the market on a given trading day. The highest price the stock can reach on the day is the upper circuit limit and the lowest price is the lower circuit limit. The limit for a stock is set to 2%, 5%, 10% or 20% based on the exchange's selection criteria. The exchange places these restrictions to control excessive volatility when a stock reacts to certain news related to the company

## Long Position

Long position or going long is simply a reference to the direction of your trade. For example, if you have bought or intend to buy Biocon shares then you are said to be long on Biocon or planning to go long on Biocon respectively. If you have bought the Nifty Index with an expectation that the index will trade higher then essentially you have a long position on Nifty. If you are long on a stock or an index, you are said to be bullish

## Short Position

Going short or simply 'shorting' is a term used to describe a transaction carried out in a particular order. This is a slightly tricky concept

The concept of shorting is very counter-intuitive simply because we are not used to 'shorting' in our day to day activity unless you have a trader mentality 🙂

Going back to stock markets, think about this very simple transaction -- on day 1 you buy shares of Wipro at Rs.405, two days later (day 3) the stock moves and you sell your shares at Rs.425. You made a profit of Rs.20/- on this transaction.

In this transaction, your first leg of the trade was to buy Wipro at Rs.405, and the second leg was to sell Wipro at Rs.425, and you were bullish on the stock.

Going forward, on day 4, the stock is still trading at Rs.425, and you are now bearish on the stock. You are convinced that the stock will trade lower at Rs.405 in a few days' time. Now, is there a way you can profit out of your bearish expectation? Well, you could, and it can be done so by shorting the stock.

You sell the stock at Rs.425, and 2 days later assuming the stock trades at Rs.405, you buy it back.

If you realize the first leg of the trade was to sell at Rs.425, and the second leg was to buy the stock at Rs.405. This is always the case with shorting -- you first sell at a price you perceive as high with the intention of buying it back at a lower price at a later point in time.

You have actually executed the same trade as buying at Rs.405 and selling at Rs.425 but in reverse order.

An obvious question you may have -- How can one sell Wipro shares without owning it. Well, you can do so, just like the way I sold a phone that I did not own.

When you first sell, you are essentially borrowing it from someone else in the market, and when you buy it back, you actually return the shares back. All this happens in the backend, and the stock exchange facilitates the process of borrowing and returning it back.

In fact, when you short a stock, it works so seamlessly that you will not even realize that you are borrowing it from someone else. From your perspective, all you need to know is that when you are bearish on the stock, you can short the stock, and the exchange takes care of borrowing the stock on your behalf. When you buy the stocks back, the exchange will ensure the stocks are returned back.

When you short, you have a bearish view on the stock. You profit if the stock price goes down. After you short, if the stock price goes up, you will end up making a loss

When you short you essentially borrow from another market participant, and you will have to deliver these shares back. You need not worry about the mechanics of this. The system will ensure all this happens in the background

Shorting a stock is easy -- either you call your broker and ask him to short the stock or you do it yourself by selecting the stock you wish to short, and click on sell

For all practical purposes, if you want to short a stock, and hold the position for few days, it is best done on the derivatives markets

When you are short, you make money when the stock price goes down. You will make a loss if the stock price goes up after you have shorted the stock.

To summarize long and short positions...

LongBuySellBullishStock goes upStock price drops

ShortSellBuyBearishStock goes downStock price goes up

## Square off

Square off is a term used to indicate that you intend to close an existing position. If you are long on a stock squaring off the position means to sell the stock. Please remember, when you are selling the stock to close an existing long position you are not shorting the stock

When you are short on the stock, squaring off a position means to buy the stock back. Remember when you buy it back, you are just closing an existing position and you are not going long!

When you areSquare off position is

LongSell the stock

ShortBuy the stock

Intraday position -- This is a trading position you initiate with an expectation to square off the position within the same day.

## Short Covering

Short covering refers to buying back borrowed securities in order to close out an open short position at a profit or loss. It requires purchasing the same security that was initially [sold short](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp), and handing back the shares initially borrowed for the short sale. This type of transaction is referred to as [buy to cover](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buytocover.asp).

- Short covering can result in either a profit (if the asset is repurchased lower than where it was sold) or for a loss (if it is higher).
- Short covering may be forced if there is a short squeeze and sellers become subject to margin calls. Measures of short interest can help predict the chances of a squeeze.

<https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortcovering.asp>

## Short Squeeze

A short squeeze is an unusual condition that triggers rapidly rising prices in a stock or other tradable security. For a short squeeze to occur, the [security](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp) must have an unusual degree of short sellers holding positions in it. The short squeeze begins when the price jumps higher unexpectedly. The condition plays out as a significant measure of the short sellers coincidentally decide to cut losses and exit their positions.

- A short squeeze accelerates a stock's price rise as short sellers bail out to cut their losses.
- Contrarian investors try to anticipate a short squeeze and buy stocks that demonstrate a strong short interest.
- Both short sellers and contrarians make risky moves. A wise investor has additional reasons for shorting or buying that stock.

<https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp>

<https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/050715/what-difference-between-short-squeeze-and-short-covering.asp>

"Short covering" and "short squeeze" are different terms to describe a situation involving short positions. A short squeeze is a situation in which a security's price increases significantly, causing short sellers to close their short positions. Conversely, short covering involves buying back a security to close out an open short position.

## Volume

Volumes and its impact on the stock prices is an important concept that we will explore in greater detail in the technical analysis module. Volumes represent the total transactions (both buy and sell put together) for a particular stock on a particular day. For example, on 17th June 2014, the volume on ACC was 5, 33,819 shares

## Market Segment

A market segment is a division within which a certain type of financial instrument is traded. Each financial instrument is characterized by its risk and reward parameters. The exchange operates in three main segments

1. **Capital Market --** Capital market segments offer a wide range of tradable securities such as equity, preference shares, warrants, and exchange-traded funds. Capital Market segment has sub-segments under which instruments are further classified. For example, common shares of companies are traded under the equity segment abbreviated as EQ. So if you were to buy or sell shares of a company you are essentially operating in the capital market segment

2. **Futures and Options (F&O) --** Futures and Option, generally referred to as the equity derivative segment is where one would trade leveraged products. We will explore the derivative markets in greater depth in the derivatives module

3. **Wholesale Debt Market --** The wholesale debt market deals with fixed income securities. Debt instruments include government securities, treasury bills, bonds issued by a public sector undertaking, corporate bonds, corporate debentures, etc.

<https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/commonly-used-jargons>

- MIS - Margin Intraday Settlement
- CNC - Cash and Carry

Select CNC for delivery trades. Meaning if your intention is to buy and hold the shares for multiple days/months/years then you need to ensure the shares reside in your Demat account. Selecting CNC is your way of communicating this to your broker.

Select NRML or MIS if you want to trade intraday. MIS is a margin product;

Buy Today, Sell Tomorrow" (BTST) or "Acquire Today, Sell Tomorrow" (ATST)

## Complexity

Simple Order

AMO - After Market Orders (after 3:30)

## CO - Cover Order

Stop loss is must (good for intraday traders, long term investors not so much)

OCO - One Cancels Other (Bracket Order)

Both target price and stop loss price

## Order Type

### Market Order - No bargain, buy at market face value

when you intend to buy at market available prices instead of a very specific price that you have in mind

### Limit - Add your bid for the stock

when you are very particular about the price you want to pay for a stock.

### SL Limit

stop loss order

### SL Market

## Position

- Intraday - Don't send to demat account
- Delivery - Send to demat account
- TIF (Time in Force)
- Day - Till the end of day if Limit get's triggered
- IOC - Now or never at Limit order

## OHLC - Open (O), high (H), low (L), and close (C)

OHLC stands for open, high, low and close. We will understand more about this in the technical analysis module. For now, open is the price at which the stock opens for the day, high is the highest price at which the stock trade during the day, low is the lowest price at which the stock trades during the day and the close is the closing price of the stock. For example, the OHLC of ACC on 17th June 2014 was 1486, 1511, 1467 and 1499.

The **Last traded price (LTP)** usually differs from the **closing price** of the day. This because theclosing priceof the day on NSE is the weighted averagepriceof the last 30 mins of trading. Last tradedpriceof the day is the actual last tradedprice.

- Gap up opening
- Gap down opening

## EPS (TTM) - Earnings per Share (Trailing Twelve Months)

Trailing 12 months (TTM) is a term used to describe the past 12 consecutive months of a company's performance data, that's used for reporting financial figures.

## Book value

Book value reflects the total value of a company's assets that shareholders of that company would receive if the company were to be liquidated

The [book value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bookvalue.asp) literally means the value of a business according to its books (accounts) that is reflected through its [financial statements](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp). Theoretically, book value represents the total amount a company is worth if all its assets are sold and all the liabilities are paid back. This is the amount that the company's creditors and investors can expect to receive if the company is liquidated.

## GDR

Aglobal depository receipt(GDRand sometimes spelleddepositary) is a general name for a [depositary receipt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depositary_receipt) where a certificate issued by a [depository bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depository_bank), which purchases [shares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_(finance)) of foreign companies, creates a [security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)) on a local [exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_exchange) backed by those shares. They are the global equivalent of the original [American depositary receipts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_depositary_receipt)(ADR) on which they are based. GDRs represent ownership of an underlying number of [shares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shares) of a foreign company and are commonly used to invest in companies from developing or [emerging markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_markets) by investors in developed markets.

Prices of global depositary receipt are based on the values of related shares, but they are traded and settled independently of the underlying share.

## Exchange-traded fund (Index ETF)

An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a collection of securities - such as stocks - that tracks an underlying [index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketindex.asp).

An ETF is called an exchange-traded fund since it's traded on an exchange just like stocks. The price of an ETF's shares will change throughout the trading day as the shares are bought and sold on the market. This is [unlike mutual funds](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/mutual-fund-etf.asp), which are not traded on an exchange, and trade only once per day after the markets close.

### What is an ETF's Market price and NAV

- The ETF market price is the price at which an ETF can be bought or sold on the exchanges during trading hours. If more buyers than sellers arise, the price will rise in the market, and the price will decline if more sellers appear.
- The net asset value (NAV) of an ETF represents the value of each share of the fund's underlying assets and cash at the end of the trading day.
- An ETF is said to trade at a **premium** when its price exceeds its NAV. An ETF is said to trade at a discount when its price is below its NAV.
- Current - 100, selling - 101 (premium), selling - 99 (discount)

### What is iNAV

- iNAV provides an intraday indicative Net Asset Value of an ETF based on the market values of its underlying constituents.
- iNAV is reported approximately every 10-15 seconds, hence it represents a near real-time view of the value of a fund..
- iNAV is a tool that helps to keep funds trading near their par value
- Reporting an iNAV can help a fund to avoid significant premium and discount trading

### Things to keep in mind when investing in ETF

- **iNAV** represents the "fair" price of an ETF, so paying substantially more (premium) or receiving substantially less (discount) than iNAV is generally ill-advised
- **How high is the tracking error?** - Tracking error is the difference between the returns of the fund and its benchmark index it is trying to mimic. A higher tracking error shows that the fund is not replicating the index truly.
- **How liquid is the fund?** - Liquidity can be an issue in case of ETFs as they can only be bought and sold on the exchanges. You would be able to sell only if there is enough demand and  that may not always be the case.
- **Expense Ratio?**

## Binary Option

A binary option is a financial product where the buyer receives a payout or loses their investment, based on if the option expires [in the money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inthemoney.asp). Binary options depend on the outcome of a "yes or no" proposition, hence the name "binary." Binary options have an expiry date and/or time. At the time of expiry, the price of the [underlying asset](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-asset.asp) must be on the correct side of the [strike price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp)(based on the trade taken) for the trader to make a profit.

## New Fund Offer (NFO)

A New Fund Offer (NFO) refers to the introductory offer of a scheme by an [asset management company](https://www.paisabazaar.com/mutual-funds/asset-management-company/). A New fund offer is raised when a fund is launched, which helps the firm raise capital for purchasing securities. An investor can subscribe to an NFO only within a limited time period; hence, NFOs are functional on first-come-first serve basis.

## Types of NFO

- [Open-ended funds](https://www.paisabazaar.com/mutual-funds/open-ended-funds/): This fund is officially launched after the NFO ends. Investors can enter and exit the fund at any time after the launch.
- Close-ended funds: A [close-ended fund](https://www.paisabazaar.com/mutual-funds/closed-end-funds/) does not allow the entry and/or exit of investors after the NFO period, until its maturity. This time period is typically 3-4 years from the launch date. However, the investors may buy and sell the units of such a fund on the stock market in theory, but the liquidity of such funds on the market tends to be low.

## SAFE Note - Simple Aggrement for Future Equity

SAFE (simple agreement for future equity) notes are a simpler alternative to [convertible notes](https://www.upcounsel.com/convertible-notes). They were created in 2013 by Y Combinator, a Silicon Valley accelerator, and allow startups to structure seed investments without interest rates or maturity dates. SAFEs are short five-page documents. The valuation caps are the only negotiable detail.

A SAFE note is a convertible security that, like an option or warrant, allows the investor to buy shares in a future priced round. It addresses many of the drawbacks and challenges posed by convertible notes and can be an equitable option for investors and [founders](https://www.upcounsel.com/blog/the-one-thing-that-every-new-entrepreneur-should-know). Startups may prefer SAFE notes because, unlike convertible notes, they are not debt and therefore do not accrue interest.

## Term sheet

- A term sheet is a nonbinding agreement outlining the basic terms and conditions under which an investment will be made.
- Term sheets are most often associated with startups. Entrepreneurs find that this document is crucial to attracting investors, such as venture capitalists (VC) with capital to fund enterprises.
- The company valuation, investment amount, percentage stake, voting rights, liquidation preference, anti-dilutive provisions, and investor commitment are some items that should be spelled out in the term sheet.
