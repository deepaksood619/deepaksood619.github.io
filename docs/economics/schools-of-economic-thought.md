### Marxian economics

**Marxian economics**, or the **Marxian school of economics**, is a [heterodox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterodox_economics) school of political economic thought. Its foundations can be traced back to Marx [critique of political economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critique_of_political_economy). Marxian economics comprises several different theories and includes multiple schools of thought, which are sometimes opposed to each other, and in many cases Marxian analysis is used to complement or supplement other economic approaches.Because one does not necessarily have to be politically [Marxist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism) to be economically Marxian, the two adjectives coexist in [usage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage) rather than being [synonymous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym). They share a [semantic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_field) while also allowing [connotative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connotation) and [denotative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denotation) differences

### Laissez-faire

Laissez-faire (from [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language):laissez faire, [lit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_translation)'let do') is an [economic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_system) in which transactions between private parties are absent of any form of [economic interventionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_interventionism) such as [regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation) and [subsidies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy). As a system of thought, laissez-fairerests on the axiomsthat the individual is the basic unit in society and has a natural right to freedom; that the physical order of nature is a harmonious and self-regulating system; and that corporations are creatures of the state and therefore the citizens must watch them closely due to their propensity to disrupt the Smithian [spontaneous order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_order).

### Anarcho-capitalism

Anarcho-capitalism is a [political philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_philosophy) and [economic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_theory) that advocates the elimination of [centralized states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralized_state) in favor of [free markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market), [private property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property) and the [right-libertarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-libertarian) interpretation of [self-ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-ownership). In the absence of [statute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute), anarcho-capitalists hold that society tends to [contractually](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract) self-regulate and civilize through participation in the free market which they describe as a [voluntary society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_society). Anarcho-capitalists support [wage labour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_labour) and believe that neither protection of person and property nor victim compensation requires a state. In a theoretical anarcho-capitalist society, the system of private property would still exist and be enforced by [private defense agencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_defense_agencies) and [insurance companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_companies) selected by customers which would operate competitively in an [open market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_market) and fulfill the roles of [courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court) and the [police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police).

## Autarky

- a country, state, or society which is economically independent
- a [military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military) autarky would be a state that could defend itself without help from another country, or could manufacture all of its weapons without any imports from the outside world.

## Capitalism

Problem with Capitalism - It creates a problem, and rather than fixing the problem, it creates a new business to solve the problem
