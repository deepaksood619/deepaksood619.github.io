Incentive Bias

- Right incentive can ensure right behavior

When people say they don't want to change what they really mean is they don't have an incentive to change.

Change the incentives and the behavior follows suit.

## Comparative Advantage

Thelaworprinciple of comparative advantageholds that under [free trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade), an agent will produce more of and consume less of a good for which they have a comparative advantage. Comparative advantageis the economic reality describing the work [gains from trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gains_from_trade) for individuals, firms, or nations, which arise from differences in their [factor endowments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_endowments) or [technological progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_progress).In an [economic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_model), [agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_(economics)) have a comparative advantage over others in producing a particular [good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_(economics)) if they can produce that good at a lower relative [opportunity cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost) or [autarky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autarky) price, i.e. at a lower relative [marginal cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_cost) prior to trade.One does not compare the monetary costs of production or even the resource costs (labor needed per unit of output) of production. Instead, one must compare the [opportunity costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost) of producing goods across countries.

[David Ricardo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo) developed the classical theory of comparative advantage in 1817 to explain why countries engage in [international trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade) even when one country's workers are more efficient at producingeverysingle good than workers in other countries. He demonstrated that if two countries capable of producing two commodities engage in the [free market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market), then each country will increase its overall consumption by exporting the good for which it has a comparative advantage while importing the other good, provided that there exist differences in [labor productivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_productivity) between both countries.Widely regarded as one of the most powerfulyet counter-intuitiveinsights in economics, Ricardo's theory implies that comparative advantage rather than [absolute advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_advantage) is responsible for much of international trade.

[Comparative Advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage#More_recent_evidence) - "An agent has a comparative advantage over another in producing a particular good if they can produce that good at a lower relative opportunity cost or autarky price, i.e. at a lower relative marginal cost prior to trade."

## Diversification

In finance, diversificationis the process of allocating capital in a way that reduces the exposure to any one particular asset or risk. A common path towards diversification is to reduce [risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_risk) or volatility by [investing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment) in a variety of [assets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset). If asset prices do not change in perfect synchrony, a diversified [portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_(finance)) will have less variance than the [weighted average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean) variance of its constituent assets, and often less volatility than the least volatile of its constituents.

Diversification is one of two general techniques for reducing investment risk. The other is [hedging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance))

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversification_(finance)

## Hedge

Ahedgeis an investment position intended to offset potential losses or gains that may be incurred by a companion investment. In simple language, a hedge is a [risk management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management) technique used to reduce any substantial losses or gains suffered by an individual or an organization.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance)

## Economies of scale

In [microeconomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microeconomics), economies of scaleare the cost advantages that enterprises obtain due to their scale of operation (typically measured by amount of output produced), with cost per unit of output decreasing with increasing scale. (In economics, "scale" is synonymous with quantity.)

Economies of scale apply to a variety of organizational and business situations and at various levels, such as a business or manufacturing unit, plant or an entire enterprise. When average costs start falling as output increases, then economies of scale are occurring. If a firm's [marginal cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_cost) of producing a good or service is beneath its [average cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_cost) of producing that good or service, then the firm is experiencing economies of scale. Some economies of scale, such as capital cost of manufacturing facilities and friction loss of transportation and industrial equipment, have a [physical or engineering basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale#Physical_and_engineering_basis).

Another source of scale economies is the possibility of purchasing inputs at a lower per-unit cost when they are purchased in large quantities.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale

## Efficient market hypothesis (EMH)

The efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) is a theory in [financial economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_economics) that states that [asset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset) prices fully reflect all available information. A direct implication is that it is impossible to "beat the market" consistently on a risk-adjusted basis since market prices should only react to new information.

The efficient-market hypothesis was developed by [Eugene Fama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Fama) who argued that stocks always trade at their fair value, making it impossible for investors to either purchase undervalued stocks or sell stocks for inflated prices.As such, it should be impossible to outperform the overall market through expert stock selection or market timing, and that the only way an investor can possibly obtain higher returns is by chance or by purchasing riskier investments.His 2012 study with [Kenneth French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_French) supported this view, showing that the distribution of abnormal returns of US mutual funds is very similar to what would be expected if no fund managers had any skill - a necessary condition for the EMH to hold.

There are three variants of the hypothesis: "weak", "semi-strong", and "strong" form. The weak form of the EMH claims that prices on traded [assets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset)(e.g., [stocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock), [bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)), or property) already reflect all past publicly available [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information). The semi-strong form of the EMH claims both that prices reflect all publicly available information and that prices instantly change to reflect new public information. The strong form of the EMH additionally claims that prices instantly reflect even hidden "insider" information.

There is no quantitative measure of market efficiency and testing the idea is difficult. So-called "effect studies" provide some of the best evidence, but they are open to other interpretations. Critics have blamed the belief in [rational markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_expectations) for much of the [late-2000s financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late-2000s_financial_crisis).In response, proponents of the hypothesis have stated that market efficiency does not mean not having any uncertainty about the future; that market efficiency is a simplification of the world which may not always hold true; and that the market is practically efficient for investment purposes for most individuals.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis

## Game Theory

Game theory is the study of [mathematical models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model) of strategic interaction between rational decision-makers.It has applications in all fields of [social science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science), as well as in [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic) and [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science). Originally, it addressed [zero-sum games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game), in which one person's gains result in losses for the other participants. Today, game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations, and is now an [umbrella term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbrella_term) for the [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science) of logical decision making in humans, animals, and computers.

- Patience - If you go to a car dealer and ask that you need a car urgent then he is not going to give you any offers, but if you say that I need a car but you will wait for the best offer and it's not urgent, then he will give you a good offer.

- Take it or leave it deal

## Scarcity

The tension between infinite wants and finite resources

Scarcityis the limited availability of a [commodity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity), which may be in demand in the market. Scarcity also includes an individual's lack of resources to buy commodities

## Supply and Demand

In [microeconomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microeconomics), supply and demandis an [economic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_model) of [price determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_determination) in a [market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_(economics)). It postulates that, [holding all else equal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceteris_paribus), in a [competitive market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_competition), the [unit price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_price) for a particular [good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_(economics)), or other traded item such as labor or liquid financial assets, will vary until it settles at a point where the quantity demanded (at the current price) will equal the quantity supplied (at the current price), resulting in an [economic equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_equilibrium) for price and quantity transacted. However, this model does not hold in cases with [positive feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback) which can lead to an [economic bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_bubble) as in the housing market in the early 21st century that led to the [subprime mortgage crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis).

## Greater Fool Theory

In [finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance) and [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics), thegreater fool theory states that the [price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price) of an object is determined not by its [intrinsic value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_value_(finance)), but rather by the local and relative demand of a specific consumer. In an inflated market, a consumer, despite having broader market knowledge might pay an inflated price because of their needs and the local related-market value. Another consumer relative to their needs and assessment of market value may deem the price excessive. Thus to one consumer the commodity has a greater value than to another making the former look like a fool to the latter.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory

## The Reward to Risk Ratio (RRR)

A good trade should be characterised by a rich RRR. In other words, for every Rs.1/- you risk on a trade your expected return should be at least Rs.1.3/- or higher, otherwise it is simply not a worth the risk.

## Value added manufacturing

Input of raw materials vs output of finished goods.

Industries/factories produce value and add value to economy

Nobel Laureate Thomas Schelling, a game theorist, coined the term **"value of a statistical life"** (VSL) in 1968

## Paradox of Thrift

The paradox of thrift, or paradox of savings, is an economic theorywhich posits that personal savings are a net drag on the economy during a recession. This theory relies on the assumption that prices do not clear or that producers fail to adjust to changing conditions, contrary to the expectations of classical microeconomics. The paradox of thrift was popularized by British economist John Maynard Keynes.

## Rule of three (Bruce Henderson of the Boston Consulting Group)

A stable competitive market never has more than three significant competitors, the largest of which has no more than four times the market share of the smallest.

I prefer a slightly different variant. Jagdish Sheth and Rajendra Sisodia, in 2002, described it like this:

1. A competitive market usually gravitates towards three major players. These three players are 'generalists', and control a significant share of the market - usually upwards of 70%.

2. The rest of the market is composed of niche specialists with tiny market shares but strong financial positions.

3. Any attempts by these specialists to become a generalist by increasing market share is risky, and can result in death.

## Cantillon effect

Cantillon effect explains how changes in the supply of money in an economy can affect the prices of different goods in different proportions. This is because the real purchasing power of individuals is not affected uniformly by the changes in money supply. The theory was proposed by Richard Cantillon, an Irish-French economist, as a counter to John Locke's crude quantity theory of money - which saw prices of all goods being affected proportionately by changes in money supply. Cantillon proposed the idea to argue that the differential effect of changes in the money supply on prices leads to booms and busts in the economy.

## Quantitative Easing

The introduction of new money into the money supply by a central bank.

Quantitative easing is an unconventional [monetary policy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp) in which a central bank purchases [government securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/governmentsecurity.asp) or other securities from the market in order to lower interest rates and increase the money supply. Quantitative easing increases the [money supply](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneysupply.asp) by flooding financial institutions with capital in an effort to promote increased lending and [liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp). When short-term interest rates are at or approaching zero, and when the printing of new [banknotes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/banknote.asp) isn't an option, quantitative easing can be considered.

## Money Supply / Money Stock

The money supply is the entire stock of [currency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency.asp) and other liquid instruments circulating in a country's economy as of a particular time. The money supply can include cash, coins and balances held in checking and savings accounts. Economists analyze the money supply and develop policies revolving around it through controlling [interest rates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) and increasing or decreasing the amount of money flowing in the economy.

## Cost Push Inflation

Cost-push inflation occurswhen overall prices increase (inflation)due to increases in the cost of wages and raw materials. Cost-push inflation can occur when higher costs of production decrease the aggregate supply (the amount of total production) in the economy.

## Paradox of Skill

While someone may be improving on an absolute basis, they are often getting worse relative to their competition. Michael Mauboussin refers to this concept as the "[Paradox of Skill](https://research-doc.credit-suisse.com/docView?language=ENG&format=PDF&source_id=em&document_id=805456950&serialid=LsvBuE4wt3XNGE0V%2B3ec251NK9soTQqcMVQ9q2QuF2I%3D)", which simply means that even though people may becoming more skilled at a certain pursuit, it is oftenmoredifficult for them to succeed because their competition is also becoming more skilled. This means that eventually the most talented people end up competing against one another, making it very difficult to become a bonafide superstar. Hence the paradox.

## Consumption

Poor's have a high marginal propensity to consume

Ex - if govt gives direct fund transfer to every citizen, then poor households will most likely be spending that money, rather than richer household which will just save that money

## The Deadweight Loss of Gift Giving

Gifting actually destroys value

Last year, I got a pen because my Santa figured that I write every day. And it’s now tucked away in a drawer (sorry!). It could happen to you as well. Maybe your aunt buys you a ₹10,000 Amazon Kindle because she figures you love books. But you actually hate reading on a screen. You like real books. And so, the Kindle slowly starts to gather dust.

Gifting can be quite inefficient.

It’s the value (or price) that’s destroyed when the gift changes hands. Or put more simplistically, it’s the gap between how much the gift giver spent and how much the receiver values the gift.

[Deadweight Loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadweight_loss) - "A loss of economic efficiency that can occur when equilibrium for a good or service is not achieved or is not achievable."

## Baumol Effect

In economics, the **Baumol effect**, also known as **Baumol's cost disease**, is the rise of wages in jobs that have experienced little or no increase in labor productivity, in response to rising salaries in other jobs that have experienced higher productivity growth.

The rise of wages in jobs without productivity gains derives from the requirement to compete for workers with jobs that have experienced productivity gains and so can naturally pay higher salaries, just as classical economics predicts. For instance, if the retail sector pays its managers low wages, they may decide to quit and get jobs in the automobile sector, where wages are higher because of higher labor productivity. Thus, retail managers' salaries increase not due to labor productivity increases in the retail sector, but due to productivity and corresponding wage increases in other industries.

Baumol helps us understand not only today’s economy but also a likely path for the economy’s future. He explained why labor-intensive services get more and more expensive as the economy grows. And those kinds of services are likely to be the future of the global economy.

## Rentseeking behaviour

The concept refers to the attempts to gain economic benefits without producing new wealth. Rather than creating a better product or offering a more efficient service, the actors in this scenario extracted vast wealth through manipulative practices.

## Jevons paradox

In economics, the **Jevons paradox** (sometimes **Jevons effect**) occurs when [technological progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_change "Technological change") or government policy increases the [efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency "Efficiency") with which a [resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_(economics) "Resource (economics)") is used (reducing the amount necessary for any one use), but the falling cost of use [induces increases in demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand) enough that resource use is increased, rather than reduced. Governments typically assume that efficiency gains will lower [resource consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_consumption "Resource consumption"), ignoring the possibility of the paradox arising.

## Lipstick index

The lipstick index is an economic theory that suggests that people buy small luxuries, like cosmetics, when the economy is struggling. The term was coined by Leonard Lauder, the former chairman of Estée Lauder.

- The theory suggests that people buy affordable luxuries to treat themselves and escape financial problems.
- The lipstick index is based on the idea that people want to feel good and satisfy psychological desires, even when times are hard.
- The lipstick index is supported by sales data, but some say it doesn't capture the whole picture of consumer splurging.

## Men's Underwear Index (MUI)

The Men's Underwear Index (MUI) is an economic indicator that suggests that an increase in men's underwear sales indicates a healthy economy. The MUI is based on the idea that people are more likely to buy non-essential items like underwear when they feel optimistic about their financial situation. Former US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan is credited with coining the MUI.
