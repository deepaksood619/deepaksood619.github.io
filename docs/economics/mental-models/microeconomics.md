# Microeconomics

Microeconomics (from Greek prefixmikro-meaning "small" +economics) is a branch of [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics) that studies the behaviour of individuals and [firms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_the_firm) in making decisions regarding the allocation of [scarce resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcity) and the interactions among these individuals and firms.

One goal of microeconomics is to analyze the [market mechanisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_mechanism) that establish [relative prices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_price) among goods and services and allocate limited resources among alternative uses. Microeconomics shows conditions under which free markets lead to desirable allocations. It also analyzes [market failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure), where markets fail to produce [efficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market_efficiency) results.

## The Demand Curve

![image](../../media/Mental-Models_Microeconomics-image1.jpg)

- A Demand Curve is a function that shows the quantity demanded at different prices
    - The Quantity Demanded is the quantity that buyers are willing (and able) to purchase at a particular price
- Demand curves can be read in two ways
    - Horizontally - The quantity buyers are willing and able to purchase at a given price
    - Vertically - the maximum price that buyers are willing to pay for a given unit of oil

- **Consumer surplus** is the consumer's gain from exchange
    - the difference between the mazimum price a consumer is willing to pay for a given quantity and the market price
- **Total consumer surplus** is the sum of consumer surplus of all buyers
- Graphically, total consumer surplus is measured by the **area below the demand curve and above the price.**

- An **increase in demand** means an increase in quantity demanded at every given price or (in other words) an increase in the maximum willingness to pay for each given quantity
- What would cause an increase in demand?
    - Anything that increases the quantity demanded at a given price or that increases the maximum willingness to pay for a given quantity
- A **decrease in demand** means a decrease in quantity demanded at every given price or (in other words) a decrease in the maximum willingness to pay for each given quantity

### Demand Shifters (Income, Population, Substitutes, Complements, Expectations, Tastes)

- The effect of changes in income on demand **depends on the nature of the good in question**
- A **Normal Good:** demand increases when income increases (and vice versa)
- An **Inferior Good:** demand decreases when income increases (and vice versa)
- Ex - When I was a student, I used to eat more at McD, but now when my income increased I eat at better restaurants, so McD consumption decreases with the rise in income.
- Two goods are **Substitutes** if an increase in the price of one good leads to an increase in demand for the other good (or vice versa)
- Two goods are **Complements** if an increase in the price of one good leads to an decrease in the demand for the other (or vice versa)
    - Ex - Petrol car and Petrol (if price increases for one, there is a decrease in demand for the other)
- The **expectation** of a higher (lower) price for a good in the future increases (decreases) current demand for the good
    - Consumers will adjust their current spending **in anticipation of the direction of future prices** in order to obtain the lowest possible price.
- Tastes and preferences are subjective and will vary among consumers

### Change in Demand vs Change in Quantity Demanded

### Elasticity of Demand

#### Elastic demand

- Price = -10%
- Demand = +15%

Elasticity of demand = 1.5

#### Inelastic demand

- Price = -10%
- Demand = +5%

Elasticity of demand = 0.5

## The supply curve

- Supply represents the behavior of sellers
- A **Supply Curve** is a function that shows the quantity supplied at different prices
    - The **Quantity Supplied** is the quantity that producers are willing and able to sell at a particular price

## Discretionary Expense

A discretionary [expense](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expense.asp) is a cost that a business or household can survive without, if necessary. Discretionary expenses are often defined as nonessential spending. This means a business or household is still able to maintain itself even if all discretionary [consumer spending](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-spending.asp) stops.

Meals at restaurants and entertainment costs are examples of discretionary expenses.
