# Collaborative Intelligence

By Dawna Markova and Angie

- There are 3 kinds of attention

    - Focused Attention - which describes being concentrated on one entity and ignoring everything else.
    - Sorting Attention - Shifting between the internal and the external. This form of attention is good for categorizing and digesting information, letting you clearly comprehend the big picture. Ex - back-and-forth of weighing different options.
    - Open Attention - Meaning our focus is diffuse, allowing us to access memories, images and ideas while producing insights and thoughts.
    - There is no one way of 'paying attention'. Our brain uses all three states to learn and think.
- 3 perceptual channels that profoundly affect the way humans process information

    - Kinesthetic - the way a lemon feels
    - Visual and printed word as well as the bright color of the fruit
    - Auditory or hearing the word "lemon" in your head
- Combining the 3 types of attention with the three perceptual channels creates six mind patterns
- 4 different cognitive styles, two from each hemisphere of the brain, for a total of four quadrants of thinking

    - Left hemisphere
        - Analytical thinking - a preference for data, facts, numbers and rationality
        - Procedural thinking - which focuses on processes, logistics, operations and tactics, like detailed step-by-step procedures
    - Right hemisphere
        - Relational thinking - all about feelings, morale, teamwork and human development
        - Innovative thinking - a congnitive preference for the future, newness, possibilities, strategy and the grand scheme of things
