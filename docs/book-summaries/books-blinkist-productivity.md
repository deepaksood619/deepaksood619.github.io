How top performers do less, work better, and achieve more

- Mastering your own work
    - Do less, then obsess
        - Choosing a few priorities
        - Dedicating your efforts toward excelling at them

        - Start with a value not with a goal
    - Don't just learn, loop
        - Micro-behavior is a small, concrete action you take on a daily basis to improve a skill. The action shouldn't take more than fifteen minutes to perform and review, and it should have a clear impact on skill development.
    - P-squared (Passion and Purpose)
- Mastering working with others
    - Forceful champions
    - Fight and unite
        - Fight - On a meeting, maximize a team debate

- Master your work-life

## 168 Hours By Laura Vanderkam

You Have More Time Than You Think

- You're not too busy -- you're just not in control of your time.
    - Instead of thinking, "I'm too busy," you should ask, "Is that a priority?" If it isn't, simply let it go.
- To live a fulfilling life, focus on your core competencies.
- Choosing a job that uses your core competencies energizes your entire life.
    - "Any 'work' that is not advancing you towards the professional life you want should not count as work. It is wasted time."
- To become time-rich you must control your work calendar.
    - Create habit of excusing yourself from meetings. If you realize a meeting isn't relevant to you, and it's a waste of your time, you should leave. And that time would be better spent pursuing activities that advance your career.
- To achieve a career breakthrough, combine strategy with story.
    - "There's a lot of randomness in the universe, but truly lucky people recognize that fairy godmothers are lazy."
- You can improve your relationships with your children by focusing on your core competencies.
    - If you both love swimming, schedule regular trips to the local pool. A love of music might mean singing together.
- Outsource housework that doesn't align with your core competencies.
- Plan your leisure time to increase its value.
- Actionable advice: Win family time by creating a mini night shift.
    - Working parents often find it difficult to spend time with their children during the week. Overcome this by blocking out 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. in your calendar every weeknight -- and view this as sacred family time. Counter your shorter day at the office by working from 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. a few nights a week. By doing this, you'll maximize your time together while the kids are still awake. Otherwise, you're more likely to waste your evening leisure time in front of the TV.
