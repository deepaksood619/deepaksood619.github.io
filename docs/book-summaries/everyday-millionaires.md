# Everyday Millionaires

By Chris Hogan

How ordinary people build extraordinary wealth - and how you can too

- Wealthy people don't get that way by taking foolish risks
- Most millionaires don't go to fancy schools or have high-paying jobs
- The buck stops with millionaires, who take responsibility for their own financial success
- Millionaires stay in control of their financial lives by practicing *intentionality*
    - **Intentionality** is the difference between deciding and sliding. If you're sliding through life, you're not in control. You're just drifting along without a plan. Deciding, on the other hand, is about being in control and making conscious choices
    - Set a **Bugdet**
- Millionaire set goals for themselves and make sure that they achieve them
    - **SMART -** Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-sensitive
- It's the consistency of millionaraires that allows their money to grow even while they're asleep
- Enlist an investment professional
    - Ask questions about their experience, certifications, philosophy and fees. After all it's your wealth, And your life.
