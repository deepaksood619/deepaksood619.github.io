# The Elephant in the Brain

- Most of our everyday actions can be traced back to some form of signaling or status seeking
- Our brains deliberately hide this fact from us and others (self deception)

So we think and say that we do something for a specific reason, but in reality, there's a hidden, selfish motive: to show off and increase our social status.

## Status Signaling / Social Signaling / Signalling

Signaling explains most of our everyday actions: what clothes we wear, which universities we pick and which religion we subscribe to. Everything has a hidden signaling component with which we communicate our desired tribal affiliation.

## Components of Signaling

- Signal Message
- Signal Distribution
- Signal Amplification
