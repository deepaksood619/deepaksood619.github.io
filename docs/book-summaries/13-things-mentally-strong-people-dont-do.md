# 13 Things Mentally Strong People Don't Do

By Amy Morin

1. Replace self-pity with gratitude
2. Hold onto their power and forgive others
    - Waiting to forgive people until they say they're sorry gives them control over not just your life, but perhaps your death
3. Are always ready to embrace change
4. Don't get distracted by things they can't control
5. Always wanting to please others doesn't work, and being ready to sometimes displease makes you stronger
6. Are not afraid of taking calculated risks
7. Coming to terms with the past makes you stronger, but it takes concrete steps to do so
8. Avoid repeating the same mistakes, and this requires self-discipline
9. Don't envy other people's success but rather seek to collaborate with them
10. Don't give up easily, and they are self-compassionate about failure
11. Are comfortable being alone and use meditation to become more resilient
12. Many people have an entitlement mentality, but strong people concentrate on giving rather than taking
13. Recognize that achievements take time and that progress isn't always immediately apparent

### Actionable advice

- Monitor how you're behaving
- Pay close attention to your feelings
- Examine your thoughts

### My Favorite Insight

When you feel like your life is out of control, take out a piece of paper and draw a horizontal line through the middle. In the top section, write “What I can't control.” In the bottom section, write “What I can control.” Then fill the sections with specific items. When populating your sheet, remember that you can't control what's happened, you can't fully control your thoughts and emotions, you can't completely control other people, and you can't entirely control the future.

But you can choose what you **focus on, what things mean, and how you behave**.

After you’ve listed the things you can and can’t control, rip off the top section, things you can’t control, and then continue tearing that top section into tiny little pieces. Better yet, go outside and light your piece of paper on fire and watch your fears burn away.
