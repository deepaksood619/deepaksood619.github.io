- Human brain evolved for action, and diagnostic reasoning (how today's affairs may have been caused by yestarday's actions)
- We reason in two different ways: intuitively and deliberately
- Two ability for all humanity's greatest accomplishments -
  - Division of cognitive labour
  - Shared intentionality
