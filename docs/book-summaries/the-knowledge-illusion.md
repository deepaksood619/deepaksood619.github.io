By Steven Sloman & Philip Fernbach

Most people feel they understand the world with far greater detail, coherence, and depth than they really do.

- Illusion of explanatory depth (IoED) - we think we know more than we actually know.
- Human brain evolved for action, and diagnostic reasoning (how today's affairs may have been caused by yestarday's actions)
- We reason in two different ways: intuitively and deliberately
- Two ability for all humanity's greatest accomplishments -
    - Division of cognitive labour
    - Shared intentionality
