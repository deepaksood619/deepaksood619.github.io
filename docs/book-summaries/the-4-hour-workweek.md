# The 4-Hour Workweek

By Tim Ferriss

- Aim high so you can create your own reality and write your own rules.
- Step outside of your comfort zone and take action now.
- Try to gain the freedom of remote working within your current job.
- Be effective on the job by working on things with the goal of gaining remote work.
- The 80/20 rule applies with work: 20% of work will bring 80% of results. So, focus on being productive instead of busy.
- Time is money. Remove things that reduce your effectiveness at the job.
- Rate the importance of a task by asking yourself, "If this is the only thing I do today, would I be happy with today?"
- Finish your high priority items before noon.
- Address email and voicemail messages after completing the high priority tasks are done. Then bundle tasks to finish them.
- Have others play by your communication rules.
- Set up an automatic source of income by outsourcing everything. The key is to use as little of your time as possible.
- Have open communication and do not let your input be a requirement in the business process.
- Delegate as much responsibility as possible.
- Validate and test your products before selling. Set up an online store with out-of-stock items and an A/B testing ad campaign.
- Establish credibility in your product category.
- Appear bigger; because people trust larger companies.
- Be picky about your customers. The 20/80 rule applies. Top 20% of your customers will be responsible for 80% of revenue, so attend to them.
- Go premium with your product because premium quality brings higher profit and customer quality.
- Don't lie to yourself and think that when staying within your comfort zone, things will magically be okay.
- Don't start your day by checking emails.
- A fulfilling life can be achieved by being mobile and flexible. This means that you can do whatever you like, whenever you like.
- Moderate, automatic income you can manage anywhere around the world allows for the mobility required for the lifestyle you truly want.
- The worst-case scenario from making a decision is usually not as bad as you think.
- Five steps to independence

  2. Move to a full time remote 9 - 5 job
  3. Gain efficiency to reduce 9 - 5 tasks to 9 - 1
  4. Use other time to automate alternative income
  5. Quit old job and live on alternative income.
