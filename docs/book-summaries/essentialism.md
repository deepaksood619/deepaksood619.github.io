# Essentialism

By Greg McKeown

- How to do better by doing less
- We should be focusing on what we should do, thinking instead about what is essential to our happiness and well-being
- 4 main points
    - Do less, but do it better
    - Reject the notion that we should accomplish everything
    - Constantly question yourself and update plans accordingly
    - Changes are put in place
- **Learned helplessness,** that is, becoming so used to the feeling of being overwhelmed that we approach our lives with passivity. (Dogs with electric shock and a lever with no effect choose to stay in shock zone, because they have learned helplessness)
    - Opposite - [learned industriousness](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/11/02/motivation/#07-05)
- Take a few hours of blank time for thinking about yourself and always see the bigger picture on why you are doing what you do
- Sleep and play are as important as work
- Be ruthless in cutting away things that aren't essential
- Say "no" to nonessential tasks and plan the essential ones carefully (How will I know when I have reached my goal)
- Stop doing unncessary things by withdrawing from failure and setting boundaries (Admit errors and mistakes and let go)
- Keeping on top of what's important requires that you eliminate what slows you down and elminate it.
- Always take 50% of buffer time that you have expected a work to take
- Building upon previous progress with small, incremental steps. Small wins create momentum, which gives you the confidence to further succeed.
- Routine is very important to achieve long term goals
