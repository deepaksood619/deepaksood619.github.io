# Think Again

By Adam Grant

- productive disagreement
- A good debate isn't about one person declaring victory, it's about both people making a discovery.
- Friction isn't inherently bad; it can be productive. If two people always agree, at least one of them is failing to think critically or speak candidly.
- A difference of opinion doesn't have to threaten a relationship, it can be an opportunity to learn. The people who teach you the most are the ones who question your thought process, not the ones who validate your conclusions.
- The ultimate purpose of debate is not to produce consensus. It's to promote critical thinking.

1. we must learn to recognise our own lazy thinking
2. we must stay critical even when we are emotional
3. we must embrace the shades of grey
4. agree on your approach to arguing
5. build up to the really toxic topics
6. agree to disagree
