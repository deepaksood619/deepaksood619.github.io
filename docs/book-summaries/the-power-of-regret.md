# The Power of Regret

[THE POWER OF REGRET by Daniel Pink | Core Message](https://youtu.be/CPsxbUod2UU)

## Anticipate future regret

## Foundation regrets: If only I'd done the work

For example: "If only I'd drank less and maintained a disciplined diet, I wouldn't have so many health problems today." Or "If only I'd worked hard in my twenties, I wouldn't be in this dead‐end job today."

## Boldness regrets: If only I'd taken that risk

For example: "If only I'd asked that girl out." Or "If only I'd started that business."

"If foundation regrets arise from the failure to plan ahead, work hard, follow through, and build a stable platform for life, boldness regrets...arise from the failure to take full advantage of that platform - to use it as a springboard into a richer life." ‐ Daniel Pink

## Moral regrets: If only I'd done the right thing

For example: "I wish I hadn't bullied that kid in school." Or "I wish I'd been faithful to my wife."

## Connection regrets: If only I'd reached out

"If only I'd reached out to my friend before she died of cancer." Or "If only I'd apologized to my son and mended our relationship sooner."

## The weekly regret template

Now that you know the four universal regrets, try to anticipate how your future‐self (living seven days in the future) might complete the following sentences:

Foundation Regrets (neglecting your health, professional growth, or finances):

- I wish I'd taken care of my health this week by...
- I wish I'd advanced my career this week by...
- I wish I'd increased my savings this week by...

Boldness Regrets (too afraid to take emotional and social risks):

- I wish I'd tried...
- I wish I'd started...
- I wish I'd asked...

Moral Regrets (not doing the right thing in difficult situations):

- I wish I'd remained loyal to...
- I wish I'd been kinder to...
- I wish I'd stood up for...

Connection Regrets (letting key relationships drift):

- I wish I'd reached out to...
- I wish I'd forgiven...
