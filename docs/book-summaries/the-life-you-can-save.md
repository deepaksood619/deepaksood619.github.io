# The life you can save

By Peter Singer

**How to do you part to end world poverty**

- We can eliminate extreme poverty, but we haven't
- Yes it's ethically wrong to keep extra cash for yourself
- Our charitable decisions aren't always based on sound arguments
    - Giving money to specific person is better than more anonymous persons
    - Giving money for saving 500 out of 1000 is better than saving 500 out of 10000 people in refugee camp
- We can increase charitable giving by creating a culture of giving
    - Reference group - if we want individuals to give more money to good causes, a great stategy is to make altruism a community effort
    - Promote the idea that giving is already a common practice
    - Making giving the default option. Some people may opt-in to voluntary pledge programs, very few people will make an effort to opt-out of programs that are already in place
- Effective aid programs aim to save as many people as possible
    - GiveWell - a nonprofit dedicated to finding and funding the most effective charities on Earth
    - Metric - examine a foundation's work in terms of cost per person helped
    - thelifeyoucansave.org, Helen Keller International, Fistula Foundation
- Your children are important, but so are everyone else's
    - All people are equally valuable
- When others won't sacrifice for the greater good, we must sacrifice more
- We should aim to donate a reasonable amount of money each year
    - 5% of annual income, but if you earn more, you pay more
- Actionable advice - Start by giving small
