CPR - Capture Process Review

[GETTING THINGS DONE by David Allen | Core Message (Remastered)](https://youtu.be/4aD8WG49PY4)

1. Capture
2. Process

   - Is it Actionable
   - Would it take 2 minutes or less
       - Yes, do it now
       - Else, go to 3.

3. Organize

   - Project
       - Personal
       - Work
   - Time
       - By deadlines (use calendar)
   - Context

4. Review

   - Weekly review the tasks for next week keeping 3-5 years vision in mind
   - Can do done at same time and place every week
   - Treat yourself after reviewing

5. Engage

- Focus. When other thoughts enter the mind, record them on an external nearby Thought Bucket.
- Empty the Thought Bucket weekly and organize it.
- Remove unimportant items, finish 2-minute tasks, and enter deadlines, or appointments in your calendar.
- Practice outcome thinking by having a project list that tracks steps leading to desired goals. The most urgent step on the project list goes to the Next Action list.
- The Next Action list should stay with you at all times so you can choose to act on them when time frees up.
- The Waiting For list can help expedite things.
- The Tickler File consists of 31 days and 12 months into the future, and is for time sensitive reminders.
- The Someday/Maybe list is for ideas in the future that are not concrete projects yet.
- Set up a functional workplace to create a cockpit of control that eases your mind.
- Review and update all of your lists weekly.
- Natural planning turns ambiguous ideas into brainstorming sessions that reduce the fog and provide clarity into actionable steps.
- Don't multitask. Focus 100% of your mental capacity on the task at hand.
- Our brain's nature is to think. Thus, thoughts might enter our mind that distract us from the current tasks.
- Daily to-do lists are inefficient because of their warped view of time.

- **Including too many tasks**
    - Ideally, create a 'top three' tasks at the beginning of your to-do list.
    - Long lists are a problem because most people aren't aware that "we only have about three to six good hours of work in us each day."
    - People also tend to underestimate how long a task takes.
- **create a fresh list for each day**
