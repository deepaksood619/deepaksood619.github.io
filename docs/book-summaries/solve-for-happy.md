# Solve for Happy

Engineer your path to joy by Mo Gawdat (26 June 2018)

- Happiness is the absence of unhappiness, caused by the misrepresentation and misunderstanding of reality
    - Your happiness is equal to or greater than your perception of events minus your expectations of life
- You are not the voice in your head, but the observer of your life
- It's important to understand that you really know nothing, and that time is, in fact, a human invention
- You don't actually have much control over your life, and your fears are often unfounded
- Our brains tend to see the negative side of things, applying too many filters, assumptions and predictions
- We tend to elaborate our memories, apply too many labels, succumb to our emotions and exaggerate things
- Modern life is overly concerned with action and speed, but a calm awareness of the present moment will keep you happy
- Things are and always will be changing, so relinquish your sense of control and go with the flow
- Unconditional love is the most important emotion, as it has no expctations, and therefore no disappointments
- Death is a fundamental part of existence. Acceptance rather than fear will allow you to properly embrace life
- In the absence of proof and the surprisingly overwhelming odds, perhaps there is a design to the Universe
