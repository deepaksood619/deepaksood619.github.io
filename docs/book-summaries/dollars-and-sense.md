# Dollars and Sense

By Dan Ariely and Jeff Kreisler

How we misthink money and how to spend smarter

- Irrational spending stems from not considering the alternatives and an overreliance on external signs of value (like coupons and discounts)
- Opportunity costs (all the things that we can buy from the same amount of money)
- Mental accounting (if you lost $100 for concert, you will pull another $100, but if you bought ticket and lose it than you will not buy ticket again)
- Emotional accounting (got money from relative or cashback, which you spend triftly)
- Language and rituals can change our perception of value (like fancy words before bottle of wine or food items in a restaurant)
- Ulysses contract for self control and budgeting (Tie the captain on mast of his ship, so wrong decisions are never an option)
- Using debit cards instead of credit cards
- Replace complex budget with simple ones
- Auto debit from paycheck for savings
