# The Organized Mind

By Daniel Levitin

Thinking straight in the age of information overload

- The brain can only focus on a limited number of stimuli at a time
    - Attentional system
- We're surrounded by more and more information, and as a result, we're focused to make more and more decisions
    - We shouldn't spend too much time on less important everyday choices. Instead, we should find shortcuts and way to simplify our decision making.
- Find a designated place for every single object
    - hippocampus for remembering the location of things
    - Designate a specific location in your house that will be home to these objects. Be strict about adhering to it
- Organize your ideas outside your head
    - Write down ideas
    - No longer have the burden of trying to remeber it all day
    - **Two minute rule -** if the task takes longer than two minutes to complete, write it down. Otherwise, do it right away
    - Writing things down conserves the mental energy expended in worrying that you might forget something and in trying not to forget it.
- Junk drawers for miscellaneous items are incredibly effective - use them every day
- Set aside time to refuel so you can increase your productivity later
    - reduce the number of things it's working on at any given moment.
    - The companies that are winning the productivity battle are those that allow their employees productivity hours, naps, a chance for exercise
- Eat a diet that's got enough protein to help neurons function properly --cellular housekeeping
- Try to avoid complacency, seek out the novel, seek out the new, that's the way to stay young.
