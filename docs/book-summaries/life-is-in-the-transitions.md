# Life is in the Transitions

Mastering Change at Any Age By Bruce Feiler

- What shape has your life story taken?
- Lifequakes shake the foundations of our existence.
- Disruptorsaffect every area of our lives
- Lifequakes force us to reevaluate what makes our lives meaningful.
- Lifequakes are by their nature disorientating, and even scary. But they also present opportunities to reevaluate our lives and what makes them meaningful.
- We can't always control disruptive events, but we do control our response to them.
    - ABC stands for autonomy, belonging, and cause
- Rituals help us to say goodbye to the lives we're leaving behind.
    - We can turn destructive events into meaningful transitions, but this requires practice. Luckily, several key tools can help us become masters at dealing with transitions.
    - The first tool we need to master is acceptance
    - A very normal reaction to experiencing a lifequake is denial and resistance.
    - Acceptance can strike in a sudden epiphany, or a series of slow realizations.
- All major transitions involve a messy middle, where we feel very lost.
- Our creativity can help us to create a new chapter in a transition.
    - Every major religious narrative and fairy tale recognizes the value of being lost. Jesus was cast into the desert before he had a major epiphany, and Mohamed gained his wisdom on a mountaintop. The most formative experience of Red Riding Hood's life would never have been possible if she hadn't wandered into that forest.
- We need to create new life stories that integrate our transitions.
- Actionable advice: Pay attention to small wins.
