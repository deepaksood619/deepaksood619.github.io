# Doing Good Better

By William MacAskill

**A radical new way to make a difference**

- When giving to charity you should give where you expect your impact to be greatest
- Given the law of diminishing returns, don't give to causes that already receive a lot
- Making the biggest impact means figuring out where you can make the biggest difference
    - Accessing the counter factual (What if you haven't done anything)
- Working for an NGO or "following your passion" may not be the best career choices
    - You should do what you are good at, and then donate a sizable income to charity causes
- What a charity actually does is much more relevant than how much it spends on administrative costs and salaries
- Often, well-intentioned acts of charity can have the opposite effect

- Charity can be a lifestyle, not merely a gift.
- Read charitably. Give the author your most favorable interpretation.
- Listen charitably. Donate your undivided attention.
- Work charitably. Be generous with your expertise.
- In this way, you make charity a daily habit.
