# Leadership and the Rise of Great Powers

By Yan Xuetong

There are four types of international leadership: humane authority, hegemonic, anemocratic, and tyrannical.

The first kind of leadership style is known as **humane authority**.This type of leadership is seen to be trustworthy by others on the international stage. By respecting international laws and norms -- like, say, a UN resolution -- a humane authority sets a good example to other states. In modern history, US president Franklin D. Roosevelt could be considered an example of this kind of leadership. He demonstrated this during his presidency when the US played a leading role in liberating countries occupied by Nazi Germany. He also helped lay the groundwork for the establishment of the United Nations.

Secondly, we come to **hegemonic leadership**. This is a type of dominant leadership that's trustworthy -- but follows a double standard. To its allies, it's helpful and trustworthy, but to its rivals, it's ruthless and doesn't abide by international norms. The leaderships of the US and the Soviet Union during the period of the Cold War could be considered hegemonic.

Then, we come to what the author calls **anemocratic leadership.** This type of leadership is both untrustworthyandfollows a double standard in its international behavior. This type of leadership doesn't follow international norms, and often acts in a contradictory and confused manner. Because of its lack of moral foundation, it's usually perceived as having zero credibility -- even with its allies. Some American scholars consider Donald Trump's leadership to be a classic example of anemocracy.

Lastly, we come to **tyrannical leadership**.When a leadership is untrustworthyandconsistent in its untrustworthiness, it's considered tyrannic. This kind of leadership has no moral restraint in the pursuit of its goals, and is feared and distrusted by both ally and rival alike. When a tyrannical state becomestheworld's dominant state, moral norms perish rather than expand. Adolf Hitler's fascist Germany and Japan's militarist government during World War II are both considered tyrannies.

Out of these four leadership styles, humane authority is best placed to create a stable international order. By embracing moral values, a humane authority will gain international credibility and be able to muster support for its ideas and reforms.
