# Chasing Excellence

By Ben Bergero

Story about building the fittest athelete

Athletic excellence isn't an elusive condition that only exists in people with the right DNA or natural talent. Anyone can achieve this excellence, as long as they have the passion, commitment and willingness to grow in more than just physical strength. If you want to master a discipline, you must develop your mental fortitude and be willing to push yourself far beyond normal limits. Without this, you'll never reach the highest peaks.

Actionable advice:

Try to think of improvement as getting better by 1 percent every day.

This kind of incremental improvement is called "aggregation of marginal gains" -- because small but meaningful buildup is a powerful tool. By the end of the year, you can make 100 percent improvements!

- If it doesn't kill you, it makes you stronger.
- Passion
- Deliberate practice
- Excellence requires a balance between strict control and knowing what you can't control
- Double loop learning (considering internal + external factors)
- Being humble
- Feeling positive creates positive results
- Your thoughts become your words, your words become your actions, and your actions dictate your destiny.
- Intense training and training for worst situations
- Having **grit** allows to push through limitations and achieve competitive excellence
