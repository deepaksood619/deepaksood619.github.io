A guide to wealth and happiness

- **A philosopher is someone who falls down a well while gazing up at the stars**
- If you're unsure about a decision, then the answer is no
- A good reputation is an invaluable asset
- If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you
  - Money can't buy happiness or make all your problems disappear, but it will solve your money problems.
  - Zero-sum game have its uses. Take Politics. If we didn't play it, we wouldn't be able to tell who was in charge of things. Fundamentally, though, it's no more than a necessary evil. That's why you should seek to avoid it in your life. Play it too often and you'll become an angry, combative, and resentful person dedicated to putting others down
  - The money game is different. It's not zero-sum, it's **positive-sum**. You can win without someone else losing, or become wealthy without condemning someone else to poverty.
- Money can give you freedom - unless you love it for its own sake
  - Money fixes a lot of external problems. It removes obstacles that stop you from doing the things you really want to do.
  - It you love money, there's never enough - it's a **bottomless pit**
- Happiness is a choice to remain in the present moment
  - Happiness is understood as the absence of judgements, which is associated with the absence of desire. The **fewer desires** you have, the greater your ability to accept the way things are right now. This brings inner calm.
  - The more you **live in the present**, the happier you'll be
  - Think of young children. On balance, they're pretty happy. Why? Easy! They're immersed in the moment rather than caught up in their own heads.
- A quiet mind is a happy mind
  - To sit **still** for 30 minutes is happiness. The reason this is so hard to achieve is that we're distracted by our desires
  - Happiness we think, is "**out there**" in the external world
  - **Monkey Mind -** Thoughts, the Buddha said, are like branches, and the conscious mind is like a monkey swinging from one branch to the next
  - The answer to this problem is to train the monkey. Meditation - quieting the simian chatter that prevents us from being present
  - Meditation comes in different forms. Hiking is Walking meditation, Journaling is Writing meditation, prayer is gratitude meditation. Even showering can be a kind of accidental meditation
- Discovering what calms your mind and building good habits are keys to happiness
  - Happiness isn't innate - it's a skill
  - Try different things and find out what works for you
  - If it works, use it; if it doesn't, look for something else
  - Cutting down on alcohol, caffeine and sugar will keep your mood more stable. So will avoiding social media
  - Regular exercise is a good habit for both your body and your mind
- Actionable advice - Lean into short-term pain (ex - working out)
