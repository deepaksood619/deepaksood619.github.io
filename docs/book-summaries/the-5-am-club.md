# The 5 AM Club

By Robin Sharma

Own your Morning. Elevate your Life

- The solitude and enhanced brain state that you'll experience at 5 a.m. will help you peform like the elite
    - We have a **limited cognitive bandwidth**. Throughout the day it is used up.
    - By getting up at 5 a.m., we can focus on one high-value activity without getting distracted.
    - At 5 a.m, we are well placed to achieve a **state of flow** in our thinking - **trasient hypofrontality**
- 5am is the time of least distraction, highest human glory and greatest peace.
- Historymakers **capitalize** on their talents, avoid distraction, achieve every day and master themselves
    - freedom from distraction is key
    - concentrating on a few amazing work projects rather than many good ones
    - Stripping out everything that distracts you from a relentless focus on what's most important
    - **day-stacking** - the small things done daily are way more important than big things done once in a while
        - Enhancing one ability or skill by just one percent every day. It's a small change, but over a year it amounts to a 365 percent improvement.
    - **personal mastery practice**
- Dedication and discipline beats brilliance and giftedness every day of the week
- Giving attention to each of the four interior empires will allow you to master yourself and your chosen field
    - Mindset
    - Healthset - your physical health
        - you can't be a titan of industry if you're dead
    - Heartset - emotional life and well-being
        - unexpressed emotions will never die. They are buried alive and they will come forth later in uglier ways.
    - Soulset - spirituality
- The 20/20/20 formula ensures that waking up at 5 a.m. generates incredible results
    - 20 minutes to move
    - 20 minutes to reflect
    - 20 minutes to grow
- Embracing sleep and the "twin-cycle of elite performance" is essential to maximizing the potential of the 5am club
- When you wake up, jump out of bed immediately, before the weaker part of our character can come up with reasons to stay under the duvet
