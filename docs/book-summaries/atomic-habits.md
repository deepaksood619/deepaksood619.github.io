# Atomic Habits

By James Clear

An easy and proven way to build good habits and break bad ones

- Habits are like the atoms of our lives. Each one is a fundamental unit that contributes to your overall improvement.
- cue, craving, response, reward
- **Implementation intentions**

Introduces a clear plan of action, setting out when and where you'll carry out the habit you'd like to cultivate

- Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity
- Humans are motivated by the anticipation of reward, so making habits attractive will help you stick to them
    - **Temptation bundling -** take a behavior that you think of as important but unappealing and link it to a behavior that you're drawn to - one that will generate that motivating dopamine hit
- If you want to build a new habit, make that habit as easy to adopt as possible
    - **Reducing friction** for creating new habits
    - Increasing friction for breaking bad habits (ex - take batteries out of remote and unplug tv)
    - **Two-minute rule -** start with just two minutes of certain habit
- Making your habits immediately satisfying is essential to effective behavior change
    - **delayed-return environment**
    - immediate return envornment
- Creating a framework to keep your habits on tract, using trackers and contracts
    - **Habit tracking** - itself is an attractive, and satisfying, habit. The anticipation and action of crossing off each day will feel good and keep you motivated
        - A habit tracker reminds you to act
        - A habit tracker motivates you to continue
        - A habit tracker provides immediate satisfaction
    - **Habit contract** - that imposes negative consequences if you fail to stay on track
- **Habit stacking** can be used to introduce new behaviors
    - stack new habit on top of an existing habit
