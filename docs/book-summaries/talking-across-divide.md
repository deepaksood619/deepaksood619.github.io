# Talking Across the Divide

By Justin Lee

How to communicate with people you disagree with and maybe even change the world

- These days many of us live in an echo chamber, which leads to group polarization
- **A single outside voice can be incredibly powerful in coutering the effects of an echo chamber**
- Bridge gaps and mend fences by using strategic dialogues
- Strategic dialogue is all about encouraging listening, and making sure each side feels like they're being heard and understood
- the more important it is to change someone's mind, the more critical the listening step becomes
- (**Mirroring**) Prove that you're listening by repeating back what someone else has said. People want to feel heard.
- Five barriers that stand in way of a successful dialogue
    - Ego protection
    - Loyalty (Group loyalty)
        - Exploiting our urge for individualism is an effective way to counter the barrier of team loyalty
        - Use Alice and Bob instead of representatives of any groups
    - Comfort
        - Status quo bias
        - Carefully raise a new discomfort that the other side hasn't thought of before
    - Misinformation
        - Explain your own experience of how you uncovered the misinformation and found the truth
        - Old saying in advertisement - People need to be exposed to a message seven times before it really sinks in
    - Worldview protection
        - making the ask (suggesting first step in the right direction)
- Actionable advice - Take notes
