# How to have impossible conversations

By Peter Boghossian and James A. Lindsay

- Impossible conversations can be productive when they become collaborative
    - Coercion is a bad way to change somebody's mind
    - Conversation is inherently collaborative, and it creates an opportunity for people to reconsider what they believe and thus potentially change how they act
- If you want to change someone's mind, you have to listen to them
    - People are more likely to accept **self-generated** ideas than messages delivered by others
    - Remember, everyone finds it deeply satisfying to be heard
- It's easier to talk openly and air disagreements when you build rapport
    - Break the ice with obvious questions about names, occupations
    - Avoid **parallel talk**
        - This is when someone tells you about their vacation in Cuba, and you take this as a cue to start talking about your time in Cuba. Asking someone questions about their holiday is an easy and effective way to build rapport.
        - Using their stories to talk about your life, by contrast, is a great way to undermine this connection
- To change someone's mind, you must first plant a seed of doubt
    - **Unread library effect**
        - Borrowing books from library but never actually reading them, and assuming that we've assimilated the knowledge in all unread books
    - **Modeling ignorance**
        - If you want somebody to recognize the limits of their knowledge, pretend to be ignorant.
        - Well, either your partner will realize that he actually doesn't know that much, or, if he really is an expert, you will be rewarded with an interesting lesson
- To foster mutual respect and openness during arguments, use **Rapoport's Rules**
    - Once your position is misrepresented by someone, your real views no longer matter. Instead, she's attacking a **straw man** - a misrepresentation that's easier to defeat than your real opinion
    - Rapoport's Rules
        - You must attempt to rephrase your partner's position in your own words. Do it as clearly and fairly as you can. You want them to say, "Wow, I wish I'd put it like that."
        - You must list every point of agreement between you and your conversation partner
        - You should tell your partner what you've learned from their argument (**pro-social modeling**)
        - You may voice disagreements only after you've gone through the previous three rules
- If evidential arguments aren't helping, try posing logical questions instead
- **What evidence can change your mind?**
- **Minimal encouragers -** Small signals that discreetly inform the speaker you're listening like Yeah, I see, OK
- Actionable advice
    - Identify the source of conflict by listening to your "moral dialect"
