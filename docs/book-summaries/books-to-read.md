## Bhagavad Gita

TheBhagavad Gita([/ˌbʌɡəvədˈɡiːtɑː,-tə/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English);[Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit_language):भगवद्गीता, [IAST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAST):bhagavad-gītā, lit. "The Song of [God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavan)"), often referred to asthe Gita, is a 700-[verse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit_prosody)[Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit) scripture that is part of the [Hindu epic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_epic)[Mahabharata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata)(chapters 23--40 of [Bhishma Parva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhishma_Parva)).

TheGitais set in a narrative framework of a dialogue between [Pandava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandava) prince [Arjuna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjuna) and his guide and charioteer [Krishna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna). At the start of the [Dharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma)[Yudhha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War)(righteous war) between [Pandavas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandava) and [Kauravas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaurava), Arjuna is filled with moral dilemma and despair about the violence and death the war will cause. He wonders if he should renounce and seeks Krishna's counsel, whose answers and discourse constitute theBhagadvad Gita. Krishna counsels Arjuna to "fulfill his [Kshatriya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kshatriya)(warrior) duty to uphold the [Dharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma)" through "selfless action".The Krishna--Arjuna dialogue cover a broad range of spiritual topics, touching upon ethical dilemmas and philosophical issues that go far beyond the war Arjuna faces.

TheBhagavad Gitapresents a synthesisof Hindu ideas about [dharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma), [theistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theism)[bhakti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti), and the [yogic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga) ideals of [moksha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moksha). The text covers [jnana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jnana_yoga), [bhakti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti_yoga), [karma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma_yoga), and [Raja Yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raja_Yoga)(spoken of in the 6th chapter) incorporating ideas from the [Samkhya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samkhya)-[Yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga) philosophy

Numerous commentaries have been written on theBhagavad Gitawith widely differing views on the essentials.[Vedanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedanta) commentators read varying relations between Self and [Brahman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman) in the text:[Advaita Vedanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta) sees the non-dualism of [Atman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80tman_(Hinduism))(soul) and Brahman as its essence, whereas [Bhedabheda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhedabheda) and [Vishishtadvaita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishishtadvaita) see Atman and Brahman as both different and non-different, and [Dvaita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvaita) sees them as different. The setting of theGitain a battlefield has been interpreted as an allegory for the ethical and moral struggles of the human life.

TheBhagavad Gitais the best known and most famous of Hindu texts, with a unique pan-Hindu influence. The Gita's call for selfless action inspired many leaders of the [Indian independence movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement) including [Bal Gangadhar Tilak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bal_Gangadhar_Tilak) and [Mahatma Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi); the latter referred to it as his "spiritual dictionary".
