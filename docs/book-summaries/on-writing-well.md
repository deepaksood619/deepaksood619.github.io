# On Writing Well

By William Zinsser

- Everybody writes, but few people care to write well
- SeCReT
    - Selective
    - Confident
    - Refined
    - Tantalizing
- Selective
    - Every successful piece of nonfiction should leave the reader with ONE provocative thought that he/she didn't have before
- Confident
    - Writing for just one reader, yourself
    - First draft
    - Removing is the quickest cure and often the best
    - Rewriting is the essence of writing - professional writers rewrite their sentences over and over and then rewrite what they have rewritten
    - Rewriting makes content Tighter, Stronger and More Precise
    - Don't hedge your prose with little timidities. Good writing is lean and confident
    - Cross out all Qualifiers i.e. sort of, a little, somewhat, etc
- Refined
    - Remove redundant verbs
    - Replace pretentious words
    - Remove wordy sentences
- Tantalizing
    - Surprising fact
    - Funny statement
    - Story
    - What opening is most likely to hook my reader?
