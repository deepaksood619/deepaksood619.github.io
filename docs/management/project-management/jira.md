## JIRA Software

Project and issue tracking

JIRA is an open, fully customizable platform for organizing teams around tasks/projects/initiatives. Task dependencies, resource accesses, permissions, hierarchies, etc can all be set up. PMs and Agile leaders can then watch software backlog planning, release planning, and overall progress. The framework of JIRA can also be used for business teams, and isn't boxed into just software development.

## Confluence

Document collaboration

Confluence is a knowledge base, or wiki, that stores and organizes all of your information assets around the projects you're doing in JIRA (like, product requirements), or general things like meeting minutes, marketing assets, design documents, how-to's etc. Confluence integrates with JIRA easily, so these assets become an integrated piece so teams can create, collaborate and update on these assets seamlessly.

## JIRA Reports

| **Chart** | **Purpose** |
|---|---|
| **Average Age Report** | Shows the average age of unresolved issues for a project or filter. This helps you see whether your backlog is being kept up to date. |
| **Created vs Resolved Issues Report** | Maps created issues versus resolved issues over a period of time. This helps you understand whether your overall backlog is growing or shrinking. |
| **Pie Chart Report** | Shows a pie chart of issues for a project or filter grouped by a specified field. This helps you see the breakdown of a set of issues, at a glance. For example, you could create a chart to show issues grouped by Assignee for a particular version in a project (using a filter). |
| **Recently Created Issues Report** | Shows the number of issues created over a period of time for a project or filter, and how many were resolved. This helps you understand if your team is keeping up with incoming work. |
| **Resolution Time Report** | Shows the length of time taken to resolve a set of issues for a project or filter. This helps you identify trends and incidents that you can investigate further. |
| **Single Level Group By Report** | Shows issues grouped by a particular field for a filter. This helps you group search results by a field, and see the overall status of each group. For example, you could view the issues in a version of a project, grouped by Assignee. |
| **Time Since Issues Report** | For a date field and project or filter, maps the issues against the date that the field was set. This can help you track how many issues were created, updated, etc over a period of time. |
| **Time Tracking Report** | Shows time tracking information on issues for a particular version of a project. |
| **User Workload Report** | Shows how much work a user has been allocated, and how long it should take. For a specified user, you'll be able to see the number of unresolved issues assigned to the specified user, and theremainingworkload, on a per-project basis. |
| **Version Workload Report** | Shows how much outstanding work there is (per user and per issue) before a given version is complete. For the specified version, you'll be able to see a list of unresolved issues assigned to each user, each user's workload, and a summary of the total remaining workload for the version. |
| **Workload Pie Chart Report** | Shows the relative workload for assignees of all issues for a project or filter. |

## Jira classic vs next-gen

### Next-gen projects are

- Faster to set-up than classic projects.You can quickly toggle on features like sprints or reports, allowing you tomix and match the best features of Scrum and Kanban
- Easier and faster to configure than classic projects.You can easily configure settings like issue types and fields with drag-and-drop editing and reordering all in a single place.
- Configured by project team members. Any team member with the project's admin rolewill can modify the settings of their next-gen projects.
- Contained to themselves.There currently is no way to associate with other project settings, schemes, global configuration objects.
- Only available on the Cloudplatform.By default, any licensed user can create these projects. You can change that if you need (see below).
- Come with a new roadmap that improves your ability to plan long-term and share your plans with stakeholders
