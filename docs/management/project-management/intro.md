## Project Factors

- Project budget: How much money is going to be spent on this project? How is it divided up?
- Timeline: When is your project due by?
- Goals: What are the project's end goals and deliverables? Start there and work backward.
- Values: How do your organizational goals and values apply to this project? Knowing this will help set expectations (and help you hold team members [accountable for their commitments](https://blog.trello.com/accountability-tips-remote-work?hsLang=en)).
- Complexity and Scale: How complex or simple is this project?
- Flexibility: How flexible or rigid is this project and its end goals, timelines, deliverables, and team or stakeholder expectations?
- Project type and industry: Some methodologies work best for certain industries and project types, such as highly creative projects or product development sprints.
- Team: Consider the team size, diversity, flexibility, experience, and individual expertise or strengths and weaknesses, as well as their ability to collaborate and communicate when choosing a methodology.

## Engineering principles

- **All-in -** This was a massive program and it needed the entire company, from exec to intern, behind it.
- **Attack the riskiest assumption -** Don't think "MVP." Think about what the riskiest part of the entire program is, and focus on that until it's no longer the top risk.
- **Incremental, even when it hurts -** Reduce risk by breaking the migration into as many small parts as possible, even when that increases dev time.
- **Sprint to 100% -** In this program, the payoff was when we could completely stop deploying to the old infrastructure. Don't slow down or lose focus until you are done.

## Daily Standup

- It is held at the same time and place every day
- It involves the same participants every day
- There is a fixed agenda that is usually to answer a fixed set of questions
    - What did you complete yesterday?
    - What do you commit to do today?
    - When do you think you'll be done with that?
    - Any blockers in your way?
- Any transgressing topic is scheduled to be discussed later, ensuring only the questions defined in the agenda are answered during the daily scrum

- **Automated, asynchronous meetings.**

## The Chicken and the Pig

The [business fable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_fable) of The Chicken and the Pig is about commitment to a project or cause. When producing a dish made of eggs with ham or bacon, the [pig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig) provides the ham or bacon which requires his or her sacrifice and the [chicken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken) provides the eggs which are not difficult to produce. Thus the pig is really committed to that dish while the chicken is only involved, yet both are needed to produce the dish.

The Chicken is involved, but the Pig commits!

## RACI Matrix

A responsibility assignment matrix (RAM), also known as RACI matrix or linear responsibility chart (LRC), describes the participation by various [roles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role) in completing [tasks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_(project_management)) or [deliverables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliverable) for a [project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project) or [business process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process). RACI is an [acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym) derived from the four key responsibilities most typically used: **responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed**. It is used for clarifying and defining roles and responsibilities in cross-functional or departmental projects and processes

## Terms

### RFQ - Request For Quote

A business sends an RFQ when they already know what they want to buy and are looking for pricing options. RFQs are often used when a company wants to compare prices from different vendors, or when they're comparing goods instead of services. An RFQ can be like a shopping list for specific pricing details, and it outlines how vendors should provide pricing data. The business will usually award the contract to the vendor with the lowest bid that meets the qualifying criteria.

### RFP - Request For Proposal

A business sends an RFP when they need more information about a product or service, or when they have a problem but aren't sure how to solve it. RFPs are often used for complex projects, and they describe the scope of a project in detail and ask suppliers to come up with different solutions. The goal of an RFP is to find the right partner for the project based on capabilities and compatibility, not just cost.

## Project Management Delivery

If you are leading a project, your only responsibility is to ensure it is delivered, whatever it takes. Here are a few pointers that I have followed

1. avoid being blocked, always find a way out
2. if there is a chance of a delay, communicate early
3. always look for trade-offs and make sure we pick the right one
4. estimate timelines well; good estimation reduces chaos
5. influence others so that they prioritize our tasks
6. always reiterate key details to ensure alignment, there is no such thing as over-communication.

On the technical and execution side, here's what I ensure

1. form a deep understanding and high clarity about the project
2. create a solid plan, reduce ambiguity, and keep the team focused
3. be agile, monitor progress, revise plan if required
4. make sure every single person involved in the project is aligned

Delivering a project requires very high focus, clarity, and persistence. Keep the big picture in mind, but execute with attention to detail.
