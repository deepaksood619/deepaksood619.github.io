# Project Management

<https://blog.trello.com/project-management-methodologies>

## Project Factors

- Project budget:How much money is going to be spent on this project? How is it divided up?
- Timeline:When is your project due by?
- Goals:What are the project's end goals and deliverables? Start there and work backward.
- Values:How do your organizational goals and values apply to this project? Knowing this will help set expectations (and help you hold team members [accountable for their commitments](https://blog.trello.com/accountability-tips-remote-work?hsLang=en)).
- Complexity and Scale:How complex or simple is this project?
- Flexibility:How flexible or rigid is this project and its end goals, timelines, deliverables, and team or stakeholder expectations?
- Project type and industry:Some methodologies work best for certain industries and project types, such as highly creative projects or product development sprints.
- Team:Consider the team size, diversity, flexibility, experience, and individual expertise or strengths and weaknesses, as well as their ability to collaborate and communicate when choosing a methodology.

## Methodologies

- Agile: Flexible, Fast, And Short Collaborative Sprint Projects
- Scrum: Quick And Continuous Development Projects
- Kanban: Visualize Task Progress For Agile Teams
- Lean: Projects That Do More With Less

Lean was created in the Japanese manufacturing industry to improve quality control and remove redundancies that may increase the price or value for customers down the line.

Known as the three M's, Lean methodology defines three types of project waste: muda, mura, and muri.

- Muda is about getting rid of the waste or anything that doesn't add value.
- Mura streamlines processes, so if one aspect of the project takes too long, for instance, then something further down the task list will have to be completed faster.
- Muri is about removing blockers, such as too many stakeholder meetings.

- Waterfall: Large-Scale, End-Goal Focused, And Fixed Projects
- Hybrid: Flexible And Fast-Paced Projects With Structured Plans

## What we need

- Advanced project & task management
- Dynamic sprint metrics & planning
- Deep linking between team members, projects, tasks, & sprints
- Overall & per sprint Block dashboards powered by filtered views
- Capacity planning (overall & per sprint)
- Story pointing process
- Project alignment to epics & workstreams
- Change request log
- Project calendar
- Pre-built backlog & change request forms
- Design review facilitation
- Personal views for projects, tasks, and dashboards
- Designed to scale yearly with easy-to-follow instructions

## Engineering principles

- **All-in--**This was a massive program and it needed the entire company, from exec to intern, behind it.
- **Attack the riskiest assumption--**Don't think "MVP." Think about what the riskiest part of the entire program is, and focus on that until it's no longer the top risk.
- **Incremental, even when it hurts--** Reduce risk by breaking the migration into as many small parts as possible, even when thatincreases dev time.
- **Sprint to 100%--** In this program, the payoff was when we could completely stop deploying to the old infrastructure. Don't slow down or lose focus until you are done, done, done, anddone.

## Daily Standup

- It is held at the same time and place every day
- It involves the same participants every day
- There is a fixed agenda that is usually to answer a fixed set of questions
  - What did you complete yesterday?
  - What do you commit to do today?
  - When do you think you'll be done with that?
  - Any blockers in your way?
- Any transgressing topic is scheduled to be discussed later, ensuring only the questions defined in the agenda are answered during the daily scrum

- **Automated, asynchronous meetings.**

## The Chicken and the Pig

The [business fable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_fable) ofThe Chicken and the Pigis about commitment to a project or cause. When producing a dish made of eggs with ham or bacon, the [pig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig) provides the ham or bacon which requires his or her sacrifice and the [chicken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken) provides the eggs which are not difficult to produce. Thus the pig is really committed to that dish while the chicken is only involved, yet both are needed to produce the dish.

The Chicken is involved, but the Pig commits!

## RACI Matrix

Aresponsibility assignment matrix(RAM), also known asRACI matrix orlinear responsibility chart(LRC), describes the participation by various [roles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role) in completing [tasks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_(project_management)) or [deliverables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliverable) for a [project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project) or [business process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process). RACI is an [acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym) derived from the four key responsibilities most typically used: **responsible, accountable, consulted, andinformed**.It is used for clarifying and defining roles and responsibilities in cross-functional or departmental projects and processes

## Process / Procedure

- Add items to backlog (cold/hot)
- Start a weekly sprint from backlog
  - Backlog grooming
  - Story points estimation (time estimation)
  - Accordingly assign tasks
- Add tasks from backlog to sprint
- Each sprint is a release (hard deadline)
- Adhoc tasks should be tagged and at last see how many adhoc task comes
- Close the sprint and start new sprint
  - Move old not completed items to next sprint

## Analytics

- Number of adhoc tasks each person is doing
- Number of tasks migrated from previous sprint to new sprint
- What each person is working on over all teams/projects
- Retrospectives
- Reviews
- Performance reports for each team member (for quaterly reviews)
