# Scrum / Meetings

- Video Calls
- Don't add all in video call (to save bandwidth)
- Do group calls

Discussions are always better than arguments, because an argument is to find out who is right, and a discussion is to find out what is right.

Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time by J. J. Sutherland

[SCRUM: Twice the Work, Half the Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaaBrPCo_Mw&ab_channel=ProductivityGame)

- Planning Fallacy
- Sunk Cost & Status Quo Bias

**Plans are worthless, Planning is everything**

## Meetings

- Pre-meeting notes - prepare for the meeting along with agenda
- Post-meeting
    - Send the final notes of what to do, when to do, who will do that
    - Share the next calendar invite for the next followup
- No presentation reading in meetings (share presentation before the meeting, or after)

## Meeting Agenda (goal-oriented)

1. What are you trying to achieve?
2. Why is it important?
3. Who do you need onboard to hit your target?
4. How much time will it take?

## Skip-level meetings

A skip-level meeting is a one-on-one meeting where upper managers meet directly with employees, bypassing the employee's direct manager, essentially "skipping" a level of management to connect directly with employees.

The goal of a skip-level meeting is twofold:

- For employeesto gain insight into company goals, objectives, and strategies.
- For senior leadersto create a shared space for employees to discuss career progression, professional goals and give feedback.

## Meetings

### Get everyone in on the action

Proactively give less dominant participants the floor by calling on them individually.On remote calls, regularly check if remote participants are able to follow the conversation and contribute.

### Interrupt interruptions

Lead by example and call out when you see someone being inadvertently silenced in a discussion. Encourage others to do the same. Come equipped with phrases like, "Hang on a sec, Fatima -- I want to make sure I understand Aniket's point before we add on to it."

If anyone is a repeat offender, take them aside for a moment after the meeting and point it out to them. Assume they're totally oblivious to their behaviors -- peoplerarelyact this way on purpose.

### Give credit where credit's due

When someone makes a good point, acknowledge their contribution and give public attribution to their ideas. Don't let hijackers get away with appropriation, and highlight when value has been added.

### Use the power of the pen

If one person is dominating, ask them to be the scribe. This intrinsically tasks them with listening and creates a space for others.

### Write and share

Give everyone time to process the question, jot down thoughts on paper, and share what they've come up with. This gives less vocal participants time to gather their thoughts and ensures they'll be heard.

### Clean up as you go

At the end of each agenda topic, pause to agree on next steps and establish specific commitments with clear deadlines. Assign Directly Responsible Individuals (DRI) and rotate the DRI role to ensure the loudest person doesn't receive all of the action items.

### Follow-ups

Circulate a follow-up note that captures the key takeaways, action items, and DRIs.This way everyone is in the loop and on the same page (consider that remote participants may not have been able to hear everything perfectly).

Proactively solicit ideas that might've come to mind after the meeting. To produce their best work, introverts need time alone to process new information. For example, send out a message along the lines of:"Anyone have a new insight about this situation since we met? If so, I'd love to hear it."

Keep tabs on action items.Assign someone to check in at appropriate intervals after the meeting to ensurethe commitments are being kept, or re-evaluated if something unexpected came up.

### Scrum vs Sprint

==Scrum is a framework for managing work, while Sprint is a framework for managing time==. Scrum is more flexible than Sprint, which is more rigid. Scrum can be used for projects of any length, while Sprint is typically used for projects lasting two or four weeks.

Scrum is a framework often used in Agile methodology. Scrum provides meetings, tools, and roles. Sprint is a defined period for creating a feature. A Sprint is a condensed period of time during which a scrum team works to complete a specific amount of work. The maximum time for a sprint is 30 days.

## Souding Board Meeting

https://smallbusiness.chron.com/adobe-creative-cloud-grow-business-13771091.html

Sounding board meetings are typically group forums designed to elicit opinions about a particular matter. Some small business owners use these types of meetings to troubleshoot new product or marketing ideas, while others use them as problem-resolution platforms. Sounding board meetings can be very advantageous, as they can help a small business owner discover breakthrough ideas or solutions to ongoing problems, as well as move forward on new projects quickly. If you are planning to launch a new product or service, or you simply want to clear up misunderstandings that are plaguing the office, plan an effective, efficient sounding board meeting.
