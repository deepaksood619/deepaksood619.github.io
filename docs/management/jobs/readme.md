### How to apply

[IndiaTechSalaries | Explore & Compare Tech Salaries in India](https://indiatechsalaries.com/)

#### 1. Make a list of target companies

- Not just companies you'll submit an app to, but companies you'd be psyched to work for!
- Aim for 15.

#### 2. Do deep research on those companies

- Listen to earnings calls, read articles, find interviews and podcasts with executives.
- What are their goals, challenges, and initiatives for the next 6-12 months?
- How can you add relevant value?

#### 3. Make a list of contacts at those companies

- Find 10-15 people at each company who could influence your ability to get hired for the role you want.
- Find their email with Mailscoop.io and save them in a spreadsheet.
- 10-15 at each company = ~150 total people.

#### 4. Schedule your emails for the new year

- One of the biggest complaints I hear from job seekers is that they don't have enough time.
- Both Gmail and Outlook have schedule send features.
- Draft up notes to every person on your contact list and schedule them to send in January.
