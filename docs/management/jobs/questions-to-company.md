## How to ask for raise / Salary negotiation

- Problem - I want a 20% raise, I did my research and my average salary should be 20% more. The positioning of the question, leaves the employer with a yes or no choice
- Go the boss in the middle of this continuum. I worked here for two and a half years. I have been here through the high times and low times. You know I am loyal. My aspirations are to stay here and grow with the organization. Can you help me figure out a path that gets me to this salary.
- It's not a yes or no game, it's allowing for conversation, it's allowing somebody to recognize that you view your own career with the organization, can you invest in me, can you take a bet on me, rather than meet my demands.
- Therefore a lot of these things fail because they're poorly presented
