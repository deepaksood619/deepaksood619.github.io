### Product

I started my professional journey with the prestigious CITI group wherein I was working on the Digital Solutions vertical of the Foreign Exchange Markets division. Strategizing for the adoption of the final products, my curiosity to know the back-story of the products piqued. From building products from scratch to deploying catalysts of growth - I wanted to know the what and why of everything!

ðŸ”‘ This inquisitive search led me to start my journey as an Associate Product Manager at a lending-fintech firm ([Stashfin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/stashfin/)) which was in its nascent stage and gave me an opportunity to become a part of their growth story. I learned how to solve problems at a macro and a micro-level. From operations, sales, and marketing to product journey and road mapping - I did everything. I loved how collaborative the job role was and how I had to wear so many hats to deliver a product feature. This was my first role where I was in a room which was age agnostic and it was just your idea that held any value.

ðŸš€ I really wanted to work on deep user-oriented problems which had a direct impact on Business and Growth. I switched to a more comprehensive fintech firm ([MobiKwik](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mobikwik/)) which is a digital wallet company that also offers credit to users. User delight and pain points became my holy bible to drive business and growth. Unstructured days, unstructured problems, and chaos became the new normal. I got the opportunity to manage products with immense scale and it was surreal to see the impact of my actions. This is where I learned that PMing is not only about getting the answers to what I should build next? but also what should I not build?

Just like the problem statements being thrown at PMs, the skillset that you will develop cannot be easily defined. I feel that being a PM forces you to pull different threads in your talent pool - the analytical mindset to read data, the creative flair for the best user journey, the smoothest sales pitch to get stakeholder buy-in, and the patience to execute end-to-end. As a PM, I need to be the CEO of my product!
