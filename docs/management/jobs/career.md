# Career

Understand how your job works, once you understand your career, create projects that will force improvement in specific skills

Explanatory Knowledge

### Before Interview - Get familiar with all the terms with that domain

1. Why you should master your career
2. Building rare and valuable skills
3. The productivity pitfall - Having a great career comes from being able to deliver value others can't
4. Career Capital (Job / Working)

Negotiating power in your career. Have a lot of it, and you get to call the shots. You get to decide whether you prefer more pay or more flexible work. You can choose work arrangements that "aren't allowed" by your company, because you can deliver on things others can't.

### Increasing Career Capital

- Deliver a product so high-quality, that your customers will swallow the price tag.
- Fix problems at the company nobody else can, that your boss is willing to tolerate that you want to work from home (even though nobody else does).
- Multi-skills person are great, like a video editor with coding experience, so he can easily edit coding videos. Like me, have experience in both management coding DevOps, hands-on, ai data etc, very broad knowledge but with depth in two or more fields

### Two ways to increase value

1. Increasing scarcity and value of what you offer
2. Doing the same work - but doing a lot of it
