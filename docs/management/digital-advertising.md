## Pricing Models

- CPM - Cost per Mile (Cost per Thousand Impressions)
- CPC - Cost per Click / PPC (Pay per Click)
- CPA - Cost per Acquisition
- CPI - Cost per Install
- CPL - Cost per Lead
- CPV - Cost per View
- CTR - Click Through Rate
- Revenue share

## CPM vs CPV: What's the Difference?

Whereas CPM determines the advertising costs per thousand ad impressions, CPV refers specifically to the cost per view of a video ad in an online marketing campaign.

While CPM is a good, cost-effective choice for advertisers looking to build brand awareness, CPV (cost per SINGLE view) is only used in campaigns for video or pop-up ads and is most often used for mobile apps.

## Tools

### Adwords

AdWords (now more commonly known as Google Ads) is a system that allows businesses to bid for advertising space in the Google search results and on other Google-affiliated properties. AdSense is a system that allows publishers and website owners to sell ad space to businesses.

### Adsense

AdSense acts as an ad network, providing you access to demand from advertisers and helping you set up your ad inventory. AdSense is best for publishers who want more automation for their ad solutions, and have a small dedicated ad management team.

AdSense is for you if you need:

- A place to monetize your website—blogs, forums, and online services perform exceptionally well on AdSense
- A fast way to implement ad delivery
- Google to optimize your ad inventory for you and maximize your revenue through [Auto Ads](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9261805)
- Accessible performance reports

Auto ads use Google's smart technology to:

- Understand your page structure
- Detect any existing Google ads on your page. (Note that we're not able to detect ads from other ad networks.)
- Automatically place new ads based on different elements such as your page layout, the amount of content on your page, and your existing Google ads. Occasionally, Auto ads might place two ads next to each other (regardless of the ads' network origin).
