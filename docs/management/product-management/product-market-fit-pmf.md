# Product Market Fit (PMF)

Finding product/market fit is the main objective of all new products. However, it's crucial to acknowledge that according to Harvard studies, the majority of startups and established organizations fail to achieve PMF. To ensure that we don't fall into the same trap with our product, or to achieve PMF quickly and efficiently, we need to take a purposeful approach. This means proactively addressing the six most common dimensions where new products fail and comprehensively focusing on all critical steps that ladder up to building a successful product.

1. Problem to solve
2. Target audience
3. Value proposition
4. Competitive advantage
5. Growth strategy
6. Business model

## GTM - Go To Market

A go-to-market (GTM) strategy is a step-by-step plan for launching a new product or expanding an existing product into a new market. It sets your initiative up for success by answering the following questions:

- What product are you selling, and what unique problem does it solve?
- Who is your ideal customer, and what pain points do they experience?
    - **Ideal customer profile (ICP)**
    - **Buyer personas**
- Where will you sell your product? What markets do you want to pursue, and what does the demand and competition look like in those markets?
- How will you reach your target customers and create demand?

    - Premium pricing
