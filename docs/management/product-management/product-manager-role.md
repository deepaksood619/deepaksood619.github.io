## Role

Your job as a PM is to deliver business impact by marshaling the resources of your team to identify and solve the most impactful customer problems.

There are three parts to this, each essential:

### Deliver business impact

Fundamentally, you are responsible for delivering business impact. If your team drives positive impact - hitting important goals, reducing costs, shipping an important project, etc. - you're doing your job.

### Marshaling the resources of your team

Your job isn't to do the building yourself but instead to increase the leverage of your cross-functional teammates - designers, engineers, data scientists, researchers - to deliver impact. To paraphrase [Andy Grove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Grove#Writing_and_teaching), a product manager's output = the output of their team.

### Identify and solve the most impactful customer problems

Business impact comes from solving customer problems. Thus, it's your job to lead your team to correctly identify, prioritize, and solve the mostimpactfulcustomer problems.

PMs are the ultimate business lever.

1. **Shape the product:** Harness insights from customers, stakeholders, and data to prioritize and build a product that will have the most impact on the business.

2. **Ship the product:** Ship high-quality product on time and free of surprises.

3. **Synchronize the people:** Align all stakeholders around one vision, strategy, goal, roadmap, and timeline to avoid wasted time and effort.

- High alignment, High Autonomy
    - We need to cross the river (Management) , figure it out how (Squads)
    - Alignment enables autonomy
- If you need to know exactly who is making decisions, you are in the wrong place
- If everything is under control you are going too slow
