# Product Manager PM Role

## Role

Your job as a PM is to deliver business impact by marshaling the resources of your team to identify and solve the most impactful customer problems.

There are three parts to this, each essential:

1. Deliver business impact

 Fundamentally, you are responsible for delivering business impact. If your team drives positive impact - hitting important goals, reducing costs, shipping an important project, etc. - you're doing your job.

2. Marshaling the resources of your team

 Your job isn't to do the building yourself but instead to increase the leverage of your cross-functional teammates - designers, engineers, data scientists, researchers - to deliver impact. To paraphrase [Andy Grove](https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlkM1yhSAMhZ9Glg4_irhg0U37CF0yaKKXuQgWsLe-ffGaYXIIIXMm32wLrjGdeo-5kCuZcu6oA76yx1IwkSNjMg606AXrGSWgO2CqV8RlsyTEzTqvSzqQ7Mfk3WyLi-EaYFR1PXnohUs79KOdl4HhICdmbU_VskhOuarX29Ye4DDMqGPwp9mtA-L1o5Q9N-Kj4Z_1YGhf7ul2BGfbmNb6dNVVPgIkfJmvFH-x4eI7ueLCamwAU9DOj1oQp6sfqyGZ5IKKlrcAUo5qGUfFJLAe2k71599P9k1Ht5W3-ZhysfOzneNGkgbE3T5zjCDZWL-s1-rvXt3cVN2O4MppMNjJI9xQyo32jcmsGDBV5GBs0UyKgQ6j4rSj8oZQqXUdrZw7Qao5xDoVtMcQzn-dRI-e), a product manager's output = the output of their team.

- High alignment, High Autonomy
  - We need to cross the river (Management) , figure it out how (Squads)
  - Alignment enables autonomy
- If you need to know exactly who is making decisions, you are in the wrong place
- If everything is under control you are going too slow
