# Retail / Offline / Sales

Well, a few years ago, professors at Wharton and Harvard delved into this phenomenon and found something quite interesting. Customers who visit a physical store spend more money. In fact, they spend 60% more on average per order. They’re willing to splurge on higher-priced items. Instead of simply buying casual T-shirts, they might spend more on buying formal shirts. They’re expanding their shopping basket.

It’s not just that. These customers even frequent the store more often. And they’re not window shopping. They’re taking out their wallets - the time between purchases also dropped by 28% versus online shoppers.

The cherry on top? They also don’t return products as much. The sale is done and final.

All this leads to one thing - the cash register rings ka-ching at physical stores! And this is what the researchers called the **supercharged consumer.**
