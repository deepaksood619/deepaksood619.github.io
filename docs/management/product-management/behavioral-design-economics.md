### Increase the immediate benefit to taking any action:forced choice and present bias

#### Forced Choice

Asked people to "accept" or "decline" the new feature. By asking people if they wanted to decline (which is definitive and final), there was now a cost to not accepting it - you might not get a second chance. Suddenly, "accept" looks much better in comparison. When we allow people to skip something or say "maybe later," there's very little cost to them.

#### Present bias

The immediate benefit to the user of taking the action should be higher than the cost of the action. This is because we tend toward ["present bias](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3909663)." In the prior example, we increased the benefit of saying "yes," by making "no" relatively more costly (definitive and final). Now we increased the benefit of saying "yes" by focusing people on a short-term goal: completing setup. People (you, your users, your customers) all want to complete things. By making people feel closer to completing something, we delivered a bigger immediate benefit.

### Make people feel like they already own it:the endowment effect

Switching email phrasing from "Join the program" to "Claim your welcome kit." drove a 120% increase in registration

Experiment with designing products that allow the user to more quickly feel psychological ownership (a form of endowment). Your product is already theirs, and by not taking action, they may lose the opportunity to benefit from it.

### Lean into existing behavior, and then make it easier: friction

Lean into what people are already doing, and then make it easier for them

### Get commitments on day one:mental models

Day 1 is the day your users have the most momentum they will ever have. Catching them at this moment with the right features and mental model will drive higher opt-in rates and engagement than at any other time in the user's lifecycle.

    - Shower
        - No idea how much water you are consuming
        - Lose track of time
        - Left with slight urge to shower more
