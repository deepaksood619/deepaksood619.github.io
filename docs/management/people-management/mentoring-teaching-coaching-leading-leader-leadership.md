# Mentoring / Leading

Leadership is the ability to guide, support, and nurture others. Leaders are adept at finding ways for others to be at their best.

A leader doesn't have to be told to step up; they just do it when it's necessary. It's automatic.

Bullying is not leadership.

Leadership is not equal to management

## Radical Candor

The best way to encourage radical candor is to be open to it youself - demonstrate the behavior you want to encourage in others

## Carrot vs Stick

Carrot and Stick Approach of Motivation. ... The carrot is a reward for moving while the stick is the punishment for not moving and hence making him move forcefully. Thus, an individual is given carrot i.e. reward when he performs efficiently and is jabbed with a stick or is given a punishment in case of non-performance.

## A brief guide to leadership

- Always know the answer to, "What are we optimizing for?"
- Recruit. Recruit. Recruit.
- Never ask someone to do something you aren't willing to do yourself.
- Give away the credit. Take the blame.

Things that keep talented people from fulfilling their potential

- Trying to please everyone
- Imitating the desires of others
- Chasing status without questioning why
- Playing superhero and trying to do it all alone
- Dividing your attention between too many projects

It's almost always better to learn from peers who are 2 years ahead of you than mentors who are 20 years ahead of you.

Life evolves and most insights get outdated.

- Human gap
- Process gap
- Training gap

## Teaching

[How Schools Can Nurture Every Student's Genius | Trish Millines Dziko | TED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUDMIA23_5s)

"He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how." -- Friedrich Nietzsche

Teachers need to internalise this. Your job is to spark curiosity in your students.

1. Assume the student has very little knowledge about the topic
2. Assume they will watch the video just once
3. Assume the attention span of the student is less than two minutes. Hook them with a joke or example
4. Tell them how this impacts them. The student doesn't care about information, they care about knowledge!

Golden Rule: When explaining a topic, choose the right level of abstraction. Once a student understands the high level concept, they dig into the details themselves.

## STAR Method

https://theinterviewguys.com/star-method

## Situation

Think of a situation similar to what the interviewer is asking you about that had a successful outcome. It doesn't necessarily have to be work related as long as it's relevant. Remember to include the **who, what, where, whenandhow.**

## Task

Describe the task you were responsible for in that situation. **Keep it specific but concise**. Make sure to highlight **any specific challenges you faced.**

## Action

This is the part where you **describe exactly what you did**. How did you complete the task you were assigned? Remember to focus on what you did and highlight traits (qualities) that a hiring manager will find desirable (initiative, [teamwork](https://theinterviewguys.com/teamwork-interview-questions/), leadership, dedication, etc.)

Result:

This is where you get to be introspective. Share what the **outcome of the situation was** and how you specifically **contributed to that outcome.** What did you accomplish? What did you learn? What were the results of your actions?
