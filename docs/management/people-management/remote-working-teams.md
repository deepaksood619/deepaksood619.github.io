# Remote Working / Teams

Teams of 1 are the best teams, and 1 of the most hard to create

Remote is a strategic advantage to some companies and poison for others

Remote work needs discipline

### TODOs

- Making remote teams meet once a month/quarter
- Daily stand-up
- Evening syncups
- Fixed set of tasks
- Everything should be written down and organized

### Benefits

- Hiring firing is easy
- Transfer operational knowledge
- Over paid vs under paid
- Really need good managers to take over team
- Creating feedback loop for every process

## Remote working tips

1. Default to action (if remote and waiting for someone respond, then default to action, take a decision and move on)

    "As far as life philosophies go, "The right time is right now" isn't a bad one. Most of us would benefit from a greater bias toward action.

    If you move fast, you can try more things. And if you try more things, you're likely to find something that works for you."

2. Over-communicate where possible
3. Make yourself available
4. Prioritize face-to-face conversations
5. Offer space to de-stress
6. Share strategies to help your local community

- Collaboration
- Results
- Efficiency
- Diversity & Inclusion
- Iteration
- Transparency - Record by default
    - Record everything, cannot afford to train people in meetings
    - self-paced learning and discovery
    - send links to avoid wasting valuable time holding meetings or getting interrupted by same questions
    - access the best version of the information

To complement the self-assessment of the stress continuum, McGladrey recently piloted a system she calls **"3-3-3"** - basically an informal **check-in three days, three weeks, and three months** after a significant event. At the three-day mark, the idea is to gauge the mental state of participants at the time of the event and identify some red flags for bad outcomes. These check-ins can also identify people who need more support."
