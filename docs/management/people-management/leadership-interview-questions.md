# Leadership Interview Questions

### Can you tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership capabilities on the job?

While I was working for my last employer, I was given a special project to oversee. It was my responsibility to ensure it was a success, including coordinating the work of other team members. To keep things on target, I scheduled a strategy meeting to divvy up duties and create a timeline. While also working through my tasks, I reached out regularly to monitor the team's progress, offering guidance and support as necessary to ensure everyone stayed motivated and that deadlines would be met. Ultimately, the project was a success, finishing on time and with all deliverables meeting or exceeding expectations.

### Which supporting skills do you think are most important when it comes to leadership?

First, I think that communication skills are crucial. I regularly use active listening when communicating with others, ensuring I fully understand their perspective. Additionally, since I've regularly worked with stakeholders who don't have the same level of specialty expertise, I've found that the ability to take complex ideas and simplify them is paramount for success. However, communication alone isn't enough. **Accountability** is also vital, as it allows me to lead by example. Similarly, critical thinking is a core component for strategic planning, and served me well when I lead a project with my past employer, which was completed on time and ultimately exceeded expectations.

### When there is a disagreement on your team, how do you handle it?

When there's a disagreement, my first step is to understand the perspective of each person involved. I use active listening skills, giving each party my full attention. I'll summarize my understanding of the situation, asking probing questions to gain additional clarity as required. At that point, my goal is to facilitate conversations that lead to resolutions. Using a calm and respectful approach, I'll work with the involved parties to find a reasonable compromise, brainstorming, and discussing ideas until a suitable option is found. The process ensures everyone can learn more about the other's perspective and that the resolution is a collaborative venture.
