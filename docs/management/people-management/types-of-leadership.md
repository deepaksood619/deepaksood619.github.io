# Types of Leadership

### 1. Transformational leadership

### 2. Situational leadership

### 3. Authoritarian leadership

### 4. Bureaucratic leadership

As the cousin of the autocratic style, bureaucratic leadership runs on rules, policy, and maintaining the status quo. The standard procedure always wins out. Proponents of this style will listen to employees, and may even acknowledge their good ideas, but if those ideas don't fit within the established system, they'll never get the green light.

### 5. Democratic leadership

The democratic approach to leadership relies on every team member providing input to help the team move towards the best decisions. The leader may still ultimately make the call, but it will likely be in sync with the conversations that have been happening across the team.

### 6. Coaching leadership

Coach-style leaders look at their team members and see oodles of potential that can be unleashed and tapped into to help the company grow. As such, coaching leadership relies on your ability to connect your team's capabilities to the right strategic opportunities. Chances are, you enjoy working with a wide variety of people and often make a massive positive impact.

### 7. Visionary leadership

Also known as "transformational leadership," this is the style most often revered in organizations that prioritize growth. Because you're constantly challenging employees to not just meet, but exceed their goals, this leadership style requires dynamic communication skills to win people over to your vision of what's possible -- both for themselves and for the company.

### 8. Servant leadership

The founding principles of servant leadership include nine behaviors:

  1. Serve first
  2. Add value to others
  3. Build trust
  4. Listen to understand
  5. Think about your thinking
  6. Increase your influence
  7. Demonstrate courage
  8. Live your values
  9. Live your transformation

  In other words, you're the type of leader who is focused on elevating their team members first, knowing that their success reflects well on you and that your own reward will follow. And, chances are, morale on your team is consistently high.

### 9. Laissez-faire leadership

This ultra-hands-off style of leadership essentially transfers all authority to employees. You're always there to hook them up with whatever resources they need, but then you let them run with it while you attend to other matters. This means your team members can take more ownership of their roles in creative ways, which can be so empowering.
