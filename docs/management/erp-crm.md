A Customer Data Platform (CDP) is a software that aggregates and organizes customer data across a variety of touchpoints and is used by other software, systems, and marketing efforts. CDPs collect and structure real-time data into individual, centralized customer profiles.

Acustomer data platform(CDP) is a type of packaged software which creates a persistent, unified customer database that is accessible to other systems. Data is pulled from multiple sources, cleaned and combined to create a single [customer profile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_profile). This structured data is then made available to other marketing systems.According to Gartner, customer data platforms have evolved from a variety of mature markets, "including [multichannel campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multichannel_campaign) management, tag management and data integration"
