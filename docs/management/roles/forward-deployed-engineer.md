# Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE)

## Core principle

A Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE) is an engineer whose primary job is to work _inside the customer’s environment_—organizationally and technically—to make a product succeed in real-world use. The “forward” part means close to the customer, not sitting behind a generic support queue.

## Derived understanding

An FDE combines software engineering with customer-facing problem solving:

- They embed with a client or operate as an extension of the customer’s team.
- They adapt, integrate, and sometimes prototype features of the company’s product to fit the customer’s specific workflows.
- They surface gaps, edge cases, and unmet needs back to product and core engineering teams.
- They often work on high-stakes, early-stage, or complex deployments where standard documentation and APIs are not enough.

## How this differs from related roles

- **Support engineer**: reacts to issues; FDE proactively builds and adapts solutions.
- **Sales engineer**: focuses on pre-sales and demos; FDE focuses on post-sales execution and long-term success.
- **Consultant**: delivers a project and exits; FDE stays tightly coupled to the product roadmap and engineering org.

## Why companies use FDEs

From first principles: complex software rarely fits real customers out of the box. FDEs reduce the gap between “what we built” and “what actually works in production” by putting engineers where the friction is highest—at the boundary between product and reality.

## Where you see this role

- AI/ML platforms (model integration, data pipelines, evaluation loops)
- Developer platforms and infrastructure companies
- High-growth startups selling to large enterprises or governments

In short, a Forward Deployed Engineer is an engineer deployed at the front lines of product–customer interaction, turning abstract capability into concrete outcomes.
