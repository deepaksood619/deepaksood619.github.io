# Engineering Manager / Tech Lead

- The tech lead is the **owner of the technological vision** for a project, and the **technical leader** of the project team.
- A tech lead is a software engineer, **responsible** for **leading** a development team, and responsible for the quality of its **technical deliverables**
- At the end of the day, it's about **making good software with a team**
- Achieve tech lead mastery in 3 easy steps:
  - **Facilitate**
    - Help your team do their jobs
    - Always be asking yourself - What's next
    - Remove roadblocks
    - Perceive the need
    - Tactic #1 - Tickets, hours & **burndowns**
    - Know the answers - Or where to find them
      - be a router
      - suggest a resource
      - tell keywords for searching in google
    - It's fine to admit not knowing something but never ever as an excuse. **"I don't know,'** should burst joyfully from your lips, followed by **'but I will find out!'**
  - **Advocate**
    - Keep the big picture in mind
    - You need to have the 10,000 foot view in your head, so you can make good decisions about what to do on the ground.
    - Try to know whys of the decision and not only what
    - Tactic #2 - Write down **everything**
      - send recap emails
    - How to advocate when talking to
      - Developers - finish in few weeks so don't overengineer
        - Always tell developers why we are doing this
      - Management
        - Advocate for developers
      - Clients
        - No but
          - Will take 3 more weeks
          - Will take 10K more
          - Let me explore and get back to you
      - Just say NO to **feature creep** (That's advocating for the project)
  - **Motivate**
    - Guide your team to the best possible result
    - Intrinsic motivation
    - First key to motivation
      - Your attitude - You set the tone for the team
        - Never let developers take blame
      - Tactic #3 - Passive-aggressive **whiteboarding**
    - **Tech lead paradox -** You're not writing the code, but you shoulder the responsibility for it.
    - Minimize Risk
      - Go after the parts that scare you the most
      - Hunt for answers until you aren't scared
    - It can be hard to code when you're a tech lead
      - Coders work on the maker's schedule
      - But TL's are on the manager's schedule
    - Growth Opportunities
      - Bored people quit

1. Remove blockers
2. Empower your team
3. Share credit, take blame
4. Never devalue people
5. Be vulnerable and authentic
6. Prioritize and focus
7. Invest in your communication skills

- **Senior tech lead**
  - The world willl no longer be binary
  - You don't need to have all the answers
    - I don't know. Let's ask someone or find someone who knows
  - Your role is not to be liked by everyone
    - If you try to please all, you please none
  - You are not alone
  - Non-technical areas are also important
  - People are complex
  - You can't do everything yourself
    - Use the **situational leadership model**
