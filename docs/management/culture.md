# Culture

Culture eats strategy for breakfast - Peter Drucker

Strong norms lesser rules

- The culture of any organization is shaped by the worst behaviour the leader is willing to tolerate -- Gruenter and Whitaker
- Culture is shaped by the best behaviour a leader is willing to promote
- The lowest common denominator of the behavior you accept -- Johanna Rothman

2. We share information openly, broadly, and deliberately

3. We are extraordinarily candid with each other

4. We keep only our highly effective people
