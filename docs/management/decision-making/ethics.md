## Panoticon

Thepanopticonis a type of institutional building and a system of control designed by the English philosopher and social theorist [Jeremy Bentham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham) in the 18th century. The concept of the design is to allow all prisoners of an institution to be observed by a single [security guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard), without the inmates being able to tell whether they are being watched.

Although it is physically impossible for the single guard to observe all the inmates' cells at once, the fact that the inmates cannot know when they are being watched means that they are motivated to act as though they are being watched at all times. Thus, the inmates are effectively compelled to regulate their own behaviour. The [architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture) consists of a [rotunda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotunda_(architecture)) with an [inspection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspection) house at its centre. From the centre the manager or staff of the institution are able to watch the inmates. Bentham conceived the basic plan as being equally applicable to hospitals, schools, sanatoriums, and asylums, but he devoted most of his efforts to developing a design for a panopticon prison. It is his prison that is now most widely meant by the term "panopticon".

## Ship of Theseus

The**Ship of Theseus**is a [thought experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment) about whether an object that has had all of its original components replaced remains the same object. According to legend, [Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theseus), the mythical Greek founder-king of Athens, had rescued the children of Athens from King [Minos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minos) after slaying the [minotaur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minotaur) and then escaped on a ship to [Delos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delos). Every year, the Athenians commemorated this legend by taking the ship on a pilgrimage to Delos to honor [Apollo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo). The question was raised by ancient philosophers: After several centuries of maintenance, if every part of the Ship of Theseus had been replaced, one at a time, was it still the same ship?
