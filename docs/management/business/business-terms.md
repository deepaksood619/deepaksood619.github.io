### GMV - Gross Merchandise Value

- Gross merchandise value (GMV) refers to the value of goods sold via customer-to-customer or e-commerce platforms.
- Gross merchandise value is calculated prior to the deduction of any fees or expenses.
- It is a measure of the growth of the business or use of the site to resell products owned by others through consignment.
- Analyzing GMV from one period to another allows management and analysts to determine the financial health of a company.
- GMV is not a true representation of a company's revenues, as a portion of the revenues goes to the original seller.

Gross Transaction Value (GTV) is a calculation of the revenue in relation to commissions. GTV is used more in businesses that operate on commissions, as GTV is equal to the number of items sold multiplied by the price collected.

### Net Revenue

- When gross revenue is recorded, all income from a sale is accounted for on the income statement. There is no consideration for any expenditures from any source.
- Net revenue reporting is instead calculated by subtracting the costÂ of goods sold from gross revenue and provides a truer picture of the bottom line.
