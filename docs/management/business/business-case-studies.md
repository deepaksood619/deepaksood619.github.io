[IKEA Business Case Study: How to Earn 40 Billion$ Every Year by Selling Furniture? (IKEA Effect)](https://youtu.be/LNmhEp0kj5Q)

The "IKEA Effect": When Labor Leads to Love

It is due to the IKEA effect that an individual perceives the value of self-made products (even though they might be amateurs) equivalent to that of products made by experts. When someone does labor to complete a task, they tend to love and value it more.

This can be understood by an example:

When instant cake mixes were introduced in the 1950's as part of a broader trend to simplify the life of the American housewife by minimizing manual labor, housewives were initially resistant. These mixes made cooking too easy, making their labor and skill seem undervalued. They completed the task simply but did not value it because it involved almost zero labor.

To counter this, manufacturers changed the recipe and instead added one more step, now to complete the cake adding an egg in the mix was a mandatory step. This small change of introducing labor appeared to be a crucial move that lead to the sales of the cake mixes.

So if you want the magic of the IKEA effect to work you need 3 things

- The task should not be too easy
- The task needs to have labor
- The task has to be completed successfully

        - Jidoka method

Jidoka direct translation in English is automation. Today, Jidoka is referred to as autonomation, which is automation with human intelligence.Jidoka also refers to stopping a manual line or process when something goes wrong. Ohno viewed the production process used by mass producers in the West to be rampant with muda -- a Japanese term for waste that encompasses all elements of production that only increase cost without adding value. For instance, excess people, inventory, and equipment are all types of muda that may exist in a factory. In order to prevent mistakes from multiplying,

Ohno placed a cord above every work station in the production facility and encouraged workers to stop the entire assembly line immediately if they discovered a problem. Once the assembly line was stopped the problem would be addressed. Ohno implemented this method with the intention of making workers more conscious of quality through Jidoka.

Jidoka places responsibility down to the assembly workers to ensure that they are mindful of the quality of each part produced.

- Henry Ford: "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses." Customers can easily describe a problem they're having - in this case, wanting to get somewhere faster - but not the best solution.

- **Shared value / Collective impact**

Collective impact is based on the idea that social problems arise from and persist because of a complex combination of actions and omissions by players in all sectors - and therefore can be solved only by the coordinated efforts of those players, from businesses to government agencies, charitable organizations, and members of affected populations. What's needed is nothing less than changing how the system functions. Collective-impact efforts have made significant progress on issues as diverse as education, homelessness, juvenile justice, substance abuse, childhood obesity, job creation, and [pollution.](http://www.collectiveimpactforum.org/featured-case-studies)

1. a common agenda, which helps align the players' efforts and defines their commitment
2. a shared measurement system
3. mutually reinforcing activities
4. constant communication, which builds trust and ensures mutual objectives
5. dedicated "backbone" support, delivered by a separate, independently funded staff, which builds public will, advances policy, and mobilizes resources.

## Auction Theory

1. The Independent Private Value (IPV) Model
2. Vickrey (Second-Price) Auction / **sealed-bid second-price auction**(**SBSPA**)

    A Vickrey auction is a sealed-bid auction where bidders submit bids without knowing the bids of other people. However, as opposed to other sealed-bid auctions, the price paid is the second-highest bid price and not the winning bid price. The Vickrey auction was named after William Vickrey, a Canadian who won the 1996 Nobel Prize in Economics for his research on [asymmetric information](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/asymmetric-information/) in economics.
