# Marketing mix modeling (MMM)

Marketing mix modeling (MMM) is a statistical analysis technique that uses sales and marketing data to measure the impact of marketing activities on sales. It's a data-driven tool that helps marketers:

- **Improve media performance** - MMM can help marketers understand the impact of their marketing and brand investments.
- **Optimize future marketing plans** - MMM can help marketers predict the impact of future marketing efforts and adjust spending on in-flight campaigns.
- **Maximize ROI** - MMM can help marketers optimize advertising mix and promotional tactics to maximize their return on investment.

MMM uses statistical models, such as multivariate regressions, to analyze sales and marketing time-series data. It can also include multi-level analysis to provide a more comprehensive view of how marketing activities influence outcomes.

When selecting a modeling technique for MMM, you can consider things like:

- **Data complexity**: Whether the data is simple or complex, and whether it has non-linear patterns
- **Model interpretability**: How easy it is to understand the model and its drivers
- **Data availability**: Whether the data required for the technique is available
- **Resource constraints**: Whether you have the computing power and expertise to implement and maintain the model
- **Business objectives**: Whether the technique aligns with your business objectives
