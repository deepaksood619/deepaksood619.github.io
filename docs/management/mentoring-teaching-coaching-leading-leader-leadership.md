# Mentoring / Teaching / Coaching / Leading / Leader / Leadership

Leadership is the ability to guide, support, and nurture others. Leaders are adept at finding ways for others to be at their best.

A leader doesn't have to be told to step up; they just do it when it's necessary. It's automatic.

Bullying is not leadership.

Leadership is not equal to management

## Types of Leadership

1. Transformational leadership
2. Situational leadership
3. Authoritarian leadership
4. Bureaucratic leadership

    As the cousin of the autocratic style, bureaucratic leadership runs on rules, policy, and maintaining the status quo. The standard procedure always wins out. Proponents of this style will listen to employees, and may even acknowledge their good ideas, but if those ideas don't fit within the established system, they'll never get the green light.

5. Democratic leadership

    The democratic approach to leadership relies on every team member providing input to help the team move towards the best decisions. The leader may still ultimately make the call, but it will likely be in sync with the conversations that have been happening across the team.

6. Coaching leadership

    Coach-style leaders look at their team members and see oodles of potential that can be unleashed and tapped into to help the company grow. As such, coaching leadership relies on your ability to connect your team's capabilities to the right strategic opportunities. Chances are, you enjoy working with a wide variety of people and often make a massive positive impact.

7. Visionary leadership

    Also known as "transformational leadership," this is the style most often revered in organizations that prioritize growth. Because you're constantly challenging employees to not just meet, but exceed their goals, this leadership style requires dynamic communication skills to win people over to your vision of what's possible -- both for themselves and for the company.

8. Servant leadership

    The founding principles of servant leadership include nine behaviors:

      1. Serve first
      2. Add value to others
      3. Build trust
      4. Listen to understand
      5. Think about your thinking
      6. Increase your influence
      7. Demonstrate courage
      8. Live your values
      9. Live your transformation

      In other words, you're the type of leader who is focused on elevating their team members first, knowing that their success reflects well on you and that your own reward will follow. And, chances are, morale on your team is consistently high.

9. Laissez-faire leadership

    This ultra-hands-off style of leadership essentially transfers all authority to employees. You're always there to hook them up with whatever resources they need, but then you let them run with it while you attend to other matters. This means your team members can take more ownership of their roles in creative ways, which can be sooooooo empowering.

## Executive Presence

- Appearance
- Communication skills
- Gravitas

## Kaizen

- Kaizen is a philosophy that productivity can be improved gradually and by involving all employees.
- The small changes can involve quality control, just-in-time delivery, standardized work, the use of efficient equipment, and the elimination of waste.
- Changes can come from any employee anytime and don't have to happen slowly, where kaizen merely recognizes that small changes now can have big future impacts.

## A brief guide to leadership

- Always know the answer to, "What are we optimizing for?"
- Recruit. Recruit. Recruit.
- Never ask someone to do something you aren't willing to do yourself.
- Give away the credit. Take the blame.

Things that keep talented people from fulfilling their potential

- Trying to please everyone
- Imitating the desires of others
- Chasing status without questioning why
- Playing superhero and trying to do it all alone
- Dividing your attention between too many projects

It's almost always better to learn from peers who are 2 years ahead of you than mentors who are 20 years ahead of you.

Life evolves and most insights get outdated.

- Reporting gap
- Human gap
- Process gap
- Training gap

## Interview Questions

### Can you tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership capabilities on the job?

While I was working for my last employer, I was given a special project to oversee. It was my responsibility to ensure it was a success, including coordinating the work of other team members. To keep things on target, I scheduled a strategy meeting to divvy up duties and create a timeline. While also working through my tasks, I reached out regularly to monitor the team's progress, offering guidance and support as necessary to ensure everyone stayed motivated and that deadlines would be met. Ultimately, the project was a success, finishing on time and with all deliverables meeting or exceeding expectations."

### Which supporting skills do you think are most important when it comes to leadership?

First, I think that communication skills are crucial. I regularly use active listening when communicating with others, ensuring I fully understand their perspective. Additionally, since I've regularly worked with stakeholders who don't have the same level of specialty expertise, I've found that the ability to take complex ideas and simplify them is paramount for success. However, communication alone isn't enough. **Accountability** is also vital, as it allows me to lead by example. Similarly, critical thinking is a core component for strategic planning, and served me well when I lead a project with my past employer, which was completed on time and ultimately exceeded expectations.

### When there is a disagreement on your team, how do you handle it?

When there's a disagreement, my first step is to understand the perspective of each person involved. I use active listening skills, giving each party my full attention. I'll summarize my understanding of the situation, asking probing questions to gain additional clarity as required. At that point, my goal is to facilitate conversations that lead to resolutions. Using a calm and respectful approach, I'll work with the involved parties to find a reasonable compromise, brainstorming, and discussing ideas until a suitable option is found. The process ensures everyone can learn more about the other's perspective and that the resolution is a collaborative venture.

1. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever made as a leader. How did you decide which course of action was best?
2. What steps do you take to make sure that projects are completed on time, on budget, and to the proper standard?

7. Tell me about your approach to delegation.
8. Can you describe a time when you lead by example?
9. Have you ever served in a coach or mentor role? How were you able to help the other person achieve success?

## STAR Method

<https://theinterviewguys.com/star-method>

## Situation

Think of a situation similar to what the interviewer is asking you about that had a successful outcome. It doesn't necessarily have to be work related as long as it's relevant. Remember to include the **who, what, where, whenandhow.**

## Task

Describe the task you were responsible for in that situation. **Keep it specific but concise**. Make sure to highlight **any specific challenges you faced.**

## Action

This is the part where you **describe exactly what you did**. How did you complete the task you were assigned? Remember to focus on what you did and highlight traits (qualities) that a hiring manager will find desirable (initiative, [teamwork](https://theinterviewguys.com/teamwork-interview-questions/), leadership, dedication, etc.)

Result:

This is where you get to be introspective. Share what the **outcome of the situation was** and how you specifically **contributed to that outcome.** What did you accomplish? What did you learn? What were the results of your actions?
