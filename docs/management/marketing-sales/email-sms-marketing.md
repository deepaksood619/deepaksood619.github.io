[Stripo - FREE Email Template Builder: Drag and Drop Html Email Editor](https://stripo.email/)

I see email being used, by and large, exactly the way I envisioned. In particular, it's not strictly a work tool or strictly a personal thing. Everybody uses it in different ways, but they use it in a way they find works for them. -- Ray Tomlinson (Inventor - Email)

## Acquiring Leads

- **Identify your target audience**

![image](../../media/Marketing-Sales-image10.jpg)

- Use Exit Intent

- **Conduct market research**
    - Learn about customer's buying habits through direct contact, such as:
        - Surveys
        - Interviews
        - Focus groups
- **Create an irresistible offer**
- **Use personalization to reel them in**
- **Setting up Email Campaigns**
    - Document your campaign's requirements
    - Draft email copy
    - Add copy to template
    - Set up tracking
    - Test your email
    - Use data and make iterations
- **Campaign Requirements**
    - Know the goal of the campaign
    - Utilize the right tone & voice in the copy that represents your brand
    - A clear "from" address & name
    - A segmented email list
    - Compelling subject line

## Workflows and sequences

- **Welcome sequence**
    - You should have a lead nurturing sequence - That warms up your leads with the best offers you company has
    - Once the first 15-day lead nurturing sequence ends, you will have to take them from off the autoresponder list and put them into a brodcast list
- **Autoresponder vs Broadcase**
    - Autoresponder - One the subscriber signs up to a chosen list automatically emails will be delivered to their inbox as per your preset rules (Date, time, e-mails...)
    - Broadcast - can be sent out right now or scheduled the email as per your requirement at any time or list you choose
- **Campaign stacking**
    - You can't build ONE email campaign or workflow to make your email marketing work
    - It just isn't enough to provide value & build a relationship
    - **The secret:** You campaign to stack them back-to-back to get the maximum sales from your contacts
- **Segment Subscribers**
- **Segmentation**
    - Dividing your list into manageable segments of people that have something in common
    - Used as a personalization to deliver more relevant email marketing to subsribers will increase conversions

## Strategies for getting a higher open-rate

- **The Double Opt-In Technique**
    - Write one email and two subject lines. Send the email with subject line one.Then the next day, send the email with subject line two to the people who didn't open subject line one. This has been shown to increase open-rateby30%.
- **Test Send Days & Times**
    - Don't listen to the myths. Every email list is different when it comes to thebest day and time to send your email. In fact many are opened as far as 2 days after they are sent. Test to see what works for you.
- **Name From Company**
    - Make sure that your readers know who is sending them messages. Make your send-from address "Name fromCompany". For example, Neil fromNeil Patel.
- **Optimize Your Preheader**
    - Most major email providers now have a"preheader"-an area next to the subject line displayed in your inbox that gives a preview of the email inside. Use this real estate wisely!
- **Optimize Your Subject Lines**
    - Constantly test subject lines to see which gets you a better open-rate. This is almost always the biggest reasonwhy someone does or does not open an email.
- **Optimize for Mobile Readers**
    - More than 50% of emails are read on a mobile device. Make sure that your email is optimized for mobile reading, so you don't miss out on getting an openfrom a mobile reader!
- **Segment Your Emails For Better Targeting**
    - People want to feel like they'respending their precious time on something that was specially meant for them. Segment your emails as specifically as possible to better give them that thoughtful one-on-one experience with your emails.

## Conversion sequence brainstorm worksheet

1. What can I use as an immediate upsell? (i.e. Email Course, Postcards/Mail, Exclusive Newsletters, Tele-Coaching, Live Events)
2. How can I leverage Facebook Custom Audiences with my list? What will I advertise regularly to stay in front of my clients on Facebook?
3. What is the best way I can leverage retargeting? What offer can I make to those people that said no to my lead magnet, tripwire, etc. to get them coming back? (Hint: You want to segment what you send them based on where they left your sales process. Personal targeting ALWAYS converts better)
4. What other product, service, or experience can I offer to expand upon, compliment, or complete my initial offer?
5. What other outside products, services, or experiences areavailable to offer from complimentary JV or Affiliate Partners?
6. What products or services can I offer with recurring billing? What product, service or experience can I offer that I can bill my customers for ongoing?
7. What different pricing levels can I offer as a billing option?How many levels of access will I offer? What will be included with each level? What price will each level be? And what pain should they fear if they disconnect?
