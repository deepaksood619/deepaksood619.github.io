# Customer Engagement / CX

When it comes to payments and finances, customers are anxious and impatient when they encounter issues.

## CX (Customer Experience)

Customer experience (CX) is the cumulative impact of every touchpoint throughout the customer journey. CX managers first determine what a positive customer experience entails for their target clients, theorize and implement changes they believe will have the most impact, and use results to optimize each customer interaction.

## What is Customer Engagement?

Quite a buzzword among online businesses today, customer engagement is a measure of a brand's interaction with its customers across all touchpoints throughout their lifecycle. Consistently engaging customers on a variety of channels help brands build and strengthen a 'human-to-human' connection with them and add value beyond just transactional relationships.

If there's anything that hasn't changed from the good ol' brick-and-mortar times to this day and age of thriving online businesses, it's the firm belief in the mantra 'Customer is King'. And with iconic marketing campaigns such as 'Share a Coke' (Coca Cola) or the 'Big Sleepover' (Ikea), giant multinational corporations have taught us that customer engagement is a key pillar of any other business strategy for happy, returning, and loyal customers.

Customer engagement is no longer limited to sales, support, or services; instead, it's an ongoing practice of brands anticipating customers' needs and keeping in touch with them to foster lasting relationships, loyalty, and hence, business growth.

Often used interchangeably, customer engagement or visitor/user engagement involves actively interacting with your audience with messaging that interests, educates, or motivates them, and encourages two-way conversations with your business basis their stage in the buying journey.

With more and more businesses adopting the customer-centric approach while developing their marketing strategies, customer engagement inevitably holds center stage in order for them to build top-of-mind awareness and achieve the intended inbound growth.
