NestJs is a framework built with Node.js, It is used for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. Nest uses progressive JavaScript and is written with TypeScript. Being built with TypeScript means that Nest comes with strong typing and combines elements of OOP(Object Oriented Programming), FP(Functional Programming) and FRP(Functional Reactive Programming).

Nest also makes use of Express, It provides an out of the box application architecture which allows for the effortless creation of highly testable, scalable, loosely coupled, and easily maintainable applications.
