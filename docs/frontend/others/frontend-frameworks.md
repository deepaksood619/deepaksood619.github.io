## Svelte

Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in thebrowser, Svelte shifts that work into acompile stepthat happens when you build your app.

Instead of using techniques like virtual DOM diffing, Svelte writes code that surgically updates the DOM when the state of your app changes.

- WHAT IS SVELTE'S MAJOR ADVANTAGE?

Svelte is compiled into pure Javascript at the build stage, so the application has no dependencies needed to start.

- HOW IS A SVELTE COMPONENT STRUCTURED?

A Svelte component may contain 3 sections: script, style, and template. The first 2 sections, however, are optional and modify the appearance and behavior, the template section is required.

- IS SVELTE'S TEMPLATE BLOCK PURE HTML?

Svelte provides an enhanced version of HTML inside the template block with extra features like variables, conditional blocks, loop blocks, async-await blocks, and more.

- HOW DO YOU SHARE DATA ACROSS A SVELTE APPLICATION?

You can share data using Svelte's Context API - a mechanism for components to connect without passing data as props, or dispatching lots of events.

## Vue.js

Vue.js is a progressive, incrementally-adoptable JavaScript framework for building UI on the web.

It is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable, and can easily scale between a library and a framework depending on different use cases. It consists of an approachable core library that focuses on the view layer only, and an ecosystem of supporting libraries that helps you tackle complexity in large Single-Page Applications.
