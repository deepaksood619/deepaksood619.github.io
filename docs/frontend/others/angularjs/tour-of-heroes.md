A directive is a marker on a HTML tag that tells Angular to run or reference some JavaScript code.

## Expressions

- Allow to insert dynamic values into HTML

## Controllers

- Controllers are where we define our app's behavior by defining functions and values.

[(ngModel)]is Angular's two-way data binding syntax.

The [*ngFor](https://angular.io/guide/template-syntax#ngFor) is Angular's *repeater* directive. It repeats the host element for each element in a list.

This is an example of Angular's [event binding](https://angular.io/guide/template-syntax#event-binding) syntax.

- Angular Framework not a library
- React is a library
- Opinionated
- Open-source
- Typescript used
- User RxJS internally
