# Microfrontend Architecture

Micro-frontend architecture is a design approach in which a [front-end](https://www.toptal.com/front-end) app is decomposed into individual, semi-independent "microapps" working loosely together.

The benefits of the micro-frontend pattern include

1. Micro-frontend architectures may be simpler, and thus easier to reason about and manage.

2. Independent development teams can collaborate on a front-end app more easily.

3. They can provide a means for migrating from an "old" app by having a "new" app running side by side with it.

Micro-frontends let you build a website or web app as a composition of features that you can create and work on separately.

- asynchronous loading, error handling, shared state, cross platform micro-frontends, how to route multiple applications together, and even how to test micro-frontend code.
