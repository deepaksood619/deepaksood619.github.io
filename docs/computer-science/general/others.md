## UUID (Universally Unique IDentifier) / GUID (Globally Unique IDentifier)

A universally unique identifier(UUID) is a [128-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/128-bit) number used to identify information in computer systems. The termglobally unique identifier(GUID) is also used, typically in software created by Microsoft.

When generated according to the standard methods, UUIDs are for practical purposes unique, without depending for their uniqueness on a central registration authority or coordination between the parties generating them, unlike most other [numbering schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbering_scheme). While the probability that a UUID will be duplicated is not zero, it is close enough to zero to be negligible.

Thus, anyone can create a UUID and use it to identify something with near certainty that the identifier does not duplicate one that has already been, or will be, created to identify something else. Information labeled with UUIDs by independent parties can therefore be later combined into a single database or transmitted on the same channel, with a negligible probability of duplication.

#### Format

In its canonical textual representation, the 16 [octets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octet_(computing)) of a UUID are represented as 32 [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal)(base-16) digits, displayed in 5 groups separated by hyphens, in the form 8-4-4-4-12 for a total of 36 characters (32 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens). For example:

123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000

xxxxxxxx-xxxx-Mxxx-Nxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

The 4 bits of digit M indicate the UUID version, and the 1--3 most significant bits of digit N indicate the UUID variant. In the example, *M* is 1, and *N* isa(10xx~2~), meaning that the UUID is a variant-1, version-1 UUID; that is, a time-based DCE/RFC 4122 UUID.

The canonical 8-4-4-4-12 format string is based on the "record layout" for the 16 bytes of the UUID:

| **Name**                           | **Length (bytes)** | **Length (hex digits)** | **Contents**                                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------|------------|------------------------------|
| time_low                           | 4                  | 8                       | integer giving the low 32 bits of the time                                                   |
| time_mid                           | 2                  | 4                       | integer giving the middle 16 bits of the time                                                |
| time_hi_and_version                | 2                  | 4                       | 4-bit "version" in the most significant bits, followed by the high 12 bits of the time     |
| clock_seq_hi_and_res clock_seq_low | 2                  | 4                       | 1--3-bit "variant" in the most significant bits, followed by the 13--15-bit clock sequence |
| node                               | 6                  | 12                      | the 48-bit node id                                                                           |

### UUID V1 : Uniqueness

UUID v1 is generated by using a combination the host computers MAC address and the current date and time. In addition to this, it also introduces another random component just to be sure of its uniqueness.

This means you are guaranteed to get a completely unique ID, unless you generate it from the same computer, and at the exact same time. In that case, the chance of collision changes from impossible to very very small because of the random bits.

This guaranteed uniqueness comes at the cost of anonymity. Because UUID v1 takes the time and your MAC address into consideration, this also means that someone could potentially identify the time and place(i.e. computer) of creation.

### UUID V4 : Randomness

The generation of a v4 UUID is much simpler to comprehend. The bits that comprise a UUID v4 are generated randomly and with no inherent logic. Because of this, there is no way to identify information about the source by looking at the UUID.

However, there is now a chance that a UUID could be duplicated. The question is, do you need to worry about it?

The short answer is no. With the sheer number of possible combinations (2^128), it would be almost impossible to generate a duplicate unless you are generating trillions of IDs every second, for many years.

If your application is mission critical (for example, bank transactions or medical systems), you should still add a uniqueness constraint to avoid UUIDv4 collision

### UUID V5: Non-Random UUIDs

If you want a unique ID that's not random, UUID v5 could be the right choice.
Unlike v1 or v4, UUID v5 is generated by providing two pieces of input information:

- Input string: Any string that can change in your application.
- Namespace: A fixed UUID used in combination with the input string to differentiate between UUIDs generated in different applications, and to prevent [rainbow table hacks](https://www.hackingloops.com/what-are-rainbow-tables/)

These two pieces of information are converted to a UUID using the SHA1 hashing algorithm.

An important point to note is UUID v5 is consistent. This means that any given combination of input and namespace will result in the same UUID, every time.

This is great if you want to, for example, maintain a mapping of your users to their UUIDs without explicitly persisting that information to storage.

However, remember that these IDs are not random, and their uniqueness is now your responsibility.

### UUID Future

- UUID Version 6 (UUIDv6) — A simple reordering of the bits within a UUIDv1 to allow it to be sorted as an opaque sequence of bytes.
- UUID Version 7 (UUIDv7) — A new time-based UUID bit layout based on the Unix Epoch timestamp already widely used in the industry.
- UUID Version 8 (UUIDv8) — A free-form format whose only requirement is to keep backward compatibility.
- Max UUID — A specialty UUID that acts as the inverse of the [Nil UUID](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122#section-4.1.7) put forth in RFC 4122

With random ID’s, values that are near each other in the index are going to be inserted at totally different times, and be in totally different places in the table.

### Which Version Should You Use?

If you don't know what to go with, go with v4. It's good enough, and the chances of collision are practically none.

If you actually want your UUID to give some indication of the date and computer in which it was created, then UUID v1 may be for you (although it is).

UUID v5 is normally used only for very specific use cases, when you want to derive a UUID from another piece of information on the fly.

### FlakeIDs

Many distributed systems have a requirement to generate time sorted, unique ids of some kind - for distinguishing incoming events, for resolving conflicts, for using as keys in key/value stores, for logging, and a whole bunch more.

The basic idea behind flake ids is simple: instead of incrementing a counter each time you need an ID, use some of the top bits in an id to represent time, and then some others to represent a "node id", such that id generation across nodes is unique. The wonderful thing about the node id is that you can just coordinateonce- very often just by writing to config files inside your orchestration tool (chef/puppet/ansible/etc).

## Indirection

In [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming), **indirection** (also called **dereferencing**) is the ability to reference something using a name, reference, or container instead of the value itself. The most common form of indirection is the act of manipulating a value through its [memory address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_address). For example, accessing a [variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(programming)) through the use of a [pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)). A stored pointer that exists to provide a reference to an object by double indirection is called an *indirection node*. In some older computer architectures, indirect words supported a variety of more-or-less complicated [addressing modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addressing_mode).

## Frequency Cap

It is a counter for unique users on a website based on session data (like cookies). There might be millions or tens of millions of users visiting a website. Frequency capping means you only show each user your ad once per day.

Redis has a [HyperLogLog data type](https://redis.io/commands/pfcount) that is perfect for a frequency cap. It approximates set membership with a very small error rate, in exchange for O(1) time and a very small memory footprint. PFADD adds an element to a HyperLogLog set. It returns 1 if your element is not in the set already, and 0 if it is in the set.

## Variadic

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) and in [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming), a **variadic function** is a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(programming)) of indefinite [arity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity), i.e., one which accepts a variable number of [arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_(computer_science)). Support for variadic functions differs widely among [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language).

## Internationalization ("i18n")

Internationalization ("i18n") is the process of adapting app code to other languages. For example, an app might need to display data in a different format, prices, or numbers with the correct decimal or thousands separators, or even handling whether text is written right-to-left or left-to-right. It also requires taking into account the user's timezone.

## Localization ("l10n")

Localization ("l10n"), is the process of preparing the content of the app to be available in different languages. This includes translating most of the app's resources, like texts, images, and sounds. Resources for different languages are usually kept in different files or directories, and the OS chooses the right one based on user settings.

### Responsiveness matters

- Walmart has found a sharp decline in conversion rates as latency climbs from 1s to 4s.
- Amazon found that every 100ms of latency cost them 1% in sales.
- Estimates from Akamai show that a 1s delay in page response can result in a 7% reduction in conversions.

## Linear-feedback shift register (LSFR)

In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing), alinear-feedback shift register(LFSR) is a [shift register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_register) whose input bit is a [linear function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear#Boolean_functions) of its previous state.

The most commonly used linear function of single bits is [exclusive-or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive-or)(XOR). Thus, an LFSR is most often a shift register whose input bit is driven by the XOR of some bits of the overall shift register value.

The initial value of the LFSR is called the seed, and because the operation of the register is deterministic, the stream of values produced by the register is completely determined by its current (or previous) state. Likewise, because the register has a finite number of possible states, it must eventually enter a repeating cycle. However, an LFSR with a [well-chosen feedback function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_polynomial_(field_theory)) can produce a sequence of bits that appears random and has a [very long cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_length_sequence).

Applications of LFSRs include generating [pseudo-random numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandomness), [pseudo-noise sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_noise), fast digital counters, and [whitening sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitening_sequences). Both hardware and software implementations of LFSRs are common.

The mathematics of a [cyclic redundancy check](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check), used to provide a quick check against transmission errors, are closely related to those of an LFSR.In general, the arithmetics behind LFSRs makes them very elegant as an object to study and implement. One can produce relatively complex logics with simple building blocks. However, other methods, that are less elegant but perform better, should be considered as well.
