# Concurrency - Reactor

The reactor [design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_(computer_science)) is an [event handling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_handling) pattern for handling service requests delivered [concurrently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)) to a service handler by one or more inputs. The service handler then [demultiplexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demultiplex) the incoming requests and dispatches them synchronously to the associated request handlers.
