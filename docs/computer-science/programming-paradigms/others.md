## Behavior-driven development

In [software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering), behavior-driven development(BDD) is an [Agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) process that encourages collaboration among developers, QA and non-technical or business participants in a software project.It encourages teams to use conversation and concrete examples to formalize a shared understanding of how the application should behave.It emerged from [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)(TDD). Behavior-driven development combines the general techniques and principles of TDD with ideas from [domain-driven design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) and [object-oriented analysis and design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_analysis_and_design) to provide software development and management teams with shared tools and a shared process to collaborate on software development.
Although BDD is principally an idea about how software development should be managed by both business interests and technical insight, the practice of BDD does assume the use of specialized software tools to support the development process.Although these tools are often developed specifically for use in BDD projects, they can be seen as specialized forms of the tooling that supports test-driven development. The tools serve to add automation to the [ubiquitous language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design#Building_blocks) that is a central theme of BDD.
BDD is largely facilitated through the use of a simple [domain-specific language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)(DSL) using natural-language constructs (e.g., English-like sentences) that can express the behaviour and the expected outcomes. Test scripts have long been a popular application of DSLs with varying degrees of sophistication. BDD is considered an effective technical practice especially when the "problem space" of the business problem to solve is complex.

## REPL Driven Development

The [REPL](https://clojure.org/guides/repl/introduction) puts developers in charge of development. Instead of "compile time", "test time", and "production time", you have dynamic, interactive environments to use as you please. You can move seamlessly back and forth between exploration, development, testing, and release, gaining instant feedback at every step and maintaining rich context and history as you go.
Some of the implications of this are obvious, while others are less so. This talk will move quickly from the basics of REPL development into more interesting territory, including:

- the importance of small steps
- using [Clojure spec](https://clojure.org/guides/spec) to explore a domain
- turning REPL work into example tests
- on-the-fly data visualization
- exploring Java libraries
- saving your work
