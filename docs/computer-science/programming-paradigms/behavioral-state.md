# Behavioral - State

The**state pattern** is a [behavioral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_pattern)[software design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) that implements a [state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_machine) in an [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented) way. With the state pattern, a state machine is implemented by implementing each individual state as a derived class of the state pattern interface, and implementing state transitions by invoking [methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_programming)) defined by the pattern's superclass.
The state pattern can be interpreted as a [strategy pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern) which is able to switch the current strategy through invocations of methods defined in the pattern's interface.
This pattern is used in [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming) to encapsulate varying behavior for the same [object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science)) based on its internal state. This can be a cleaner way for an object to change its behavior at runtime without resorting to large monolithic conditional statementsand thus improve maintainability.
