## YAGNI - You Ain't Gonna Need It. (For new features)

"You aren't gonna need it" (YAGNI)is a principle of [extreme programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming)(XP) that states a [programmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer) should not add functionality until deemed necessary.

## Others

- KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid
- DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
- DIE - Duplication Is Evil
- SoC - Separation of Concerns
- Research first code later

## Objectives and Key Results (OKR / OKRs)

Used for setting, communicating and monitoring quarterly goals and results in organizations.

## Yak Shaving

Yak shaving is programming lingo for the seemingly endless series of small tasks that have to be completed before the next step in a project can move forward.

### Example

- You start with the desire to wax your car.
- To wax your car, you need a water hose. Only, your water hose is busted so you need to go down to the hardware store to get a new hose.
- To get to the hardware store, you have to drive across a bridge. The bridge requires a pass or ticket. You can't find your pass, but you know your neighbor has one.
- However, your neighbor won't lend you his pass until you return a pillow that you borrowed. The reason you haven't returned it is because the pillow is missing some stuffing.
- The pillow was originally stuffed with yak hair. In order to re-stuff the pillow you need to get some new yak hair.
- And that's how you end up shaving a yak, when all you really wanted to do was wax your car.
