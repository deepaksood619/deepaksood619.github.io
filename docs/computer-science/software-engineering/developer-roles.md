- Retention
- Promotion
- Support time-wasting
- Better use of investment time (learning lunches)
- Prioritize depth over breadth
- Occasionally, allocate full days

- Solidifies there knowledge
- Creates documentation
- Build authority and brand
- Let devs audit extra meetings

## Developer vs Engineer

Developer - A developer executes. Their talents often focused to a single area. Without need for the "big picture".

Engineer - An engineer designs and plans. Always aware of the "big picture". With talents in many areas. An engineer can assume the developer role. But an engineer's core focus lies with architecture.

### Engineers Salary Comparision

There is a simple reason some engineers are worth +$1,000,000 per year:

Leverage.

There are the three main ways top engineers have leverage:

#### 1. They write impactful software no one else can

Software at large companies is already high leverage. A single change can have a ton of impact (`$$$`) at scale.

This impact makes it worth it to pay a lot for their specialized skills.

#### 2. They influence large groups of engineers

Imagine a tech lead among tech leads. They might lead the planning, design, and delivery of initiatives that involve 30+ engineers.

This influence gives them leverage and amplifies their impact.

#### 3. They help engineers move faster at scale

Their work often has compounding effects by making improvements to tooling or underlying infrastructure everyone uses.

Imagine making 1000 engineers 3% faster. That "creates" 30 more engineers worth of bandwidth out of thin air.

Most engineers will not get to these levels, but there's something we can still learn from them.

The best way to have more impact is not to invest more time but to think about how to get more out of it through leverage.
