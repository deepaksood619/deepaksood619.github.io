# Refactoring

## The 7 R's: Common use cases and deployment

- Rehost (also known as "lift-and-shift")

    Quickly moving applications to the cloud without changing them.

- Refactor (also known as rearchitect)

    Changing the way applications are architected and developed, usually by employing cloud-native features.

- Re-platform (sometimes referred to as "lift-tinker-and-shift")

    Making a few optimizations to applications - but without changing their core architecture, like moving from self-managed Kubernetes to Amazon EKS.

- Repurchase (casually known as "drop and shop")

    Replacing your current environment by moving to a newer version of software or purchasing an entirely new solution.

- Relocate

    Using VMware Cloud on AWS to quickly relocate up to hundreds of applications virtualized on vSphere to the AWS Cloud in days and without changing them.

- Retire

    Identifying assets that are no longer useful and turning them off, strengthening your business case by focusing on more widely used resources.

- Retain

    Leaving the application on-premises - for now, at least.
