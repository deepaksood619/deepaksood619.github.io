# Technical Debt

## Lehman's Laws of Software Evolution

### Continuing Change

A system must be continually adapted or it becomes progressively less satisfactory

### Increasing Complexity

As a system evolves, it's complexity increases unless work is done to maintan or reduce it

## Others

- Kiss of death
- Are we treating symptoms instead of real issues
- Quantifying technical debt
- There's always a trade off between improving existing code versus adding new features

## Symptoms of low code health

- **Low cohension,** many reponsibilities
- **Bumpy road code smell,** lack of encapsulation
- **Deeply nested logic**, if-statements inside if-statements
- **Primitive obsession,** missing a domain language
- **Excess function arguments,** missing abstractions

- Slow down to speed up
- Organisations often overestimate the importance of the features they continuously ship (and underestimate the importance of features they don't ship)
- Don't fix what is not broken, but fix what might soon break
- Technical debt is a reality of life
  - No business goals, vision, strategy, or competitive advantage changes the fact that technical debt is inevitable and that it needs to be handled.
- A developer should know why something is being done to the software they write and maintain. That is when they can truly "own" it, maintain a current mental model without outright hating the codebase, and assimilate changes meaningfully rather than shoehorning them in.
