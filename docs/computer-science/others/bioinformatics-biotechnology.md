## PDB - Protein Data Bank

The**Protein Data Bank**(**PDB**) is a [crystallographic database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallographic_database) for the three-dimensional structural data of large biological molecules, such as [proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein) and [nucleic acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid). The data, typically obtained by [X-ray crystallography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_crystallography), [NMR spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy_of_proteins), or, increasingly, [cryo-electron microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryo-electron_microscopy),

## RCSB

Led by Helen M. Berman, the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) became responsible for the management of thePDBin 1998.

## mmCIF

## Crystallographic Information File(CIF) is a standard text file format for representing [crystallographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallographic) information, promulgated by the [International Union of Crystallography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_of_Crystallography)(IUCr)

mmCIF, macromolecular CIF, which is intended as an alternative to the [Protein Data Bank (PDB) format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Data_Bank_(file_format)). Also closely related is Crystallographic Information Framework, a broader system of exchange protocols based on data dictionaries and relational rules expressible in different machine-readable manifestations, including, but not restricted to, Crystallographic Information File and [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML)
