# Gamification

The use of game elements and game design techniques in non-game contexts

Common game elements

| **Game element** | **Definition**                                                                            |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Feedback         | Immediate notification that keep users constantly aware of progress or failures           |
| Goals            | Activity goals that are adapted as challenges for the user                                |
| Badges           | Optional rewards and goals outside the scope of a service's core activities               |
| Point system     | Reward for completing actions (that is, a numeric value that's added to the total points) |
| Leaderboard      | Tracking and displaying desired actions to drive desired behavior through competition     |
| User levels      | Indication of the user's proficiency in the overall gaming experience over time           |
Two types of users -

1. **Achievers -** are eager to complete the many challenges with which they're confronted.
2. **Explorers -** trive to find hidden items they can likely collect by exploring a software system's different areas

## Octalysis Gamification Framework

The Octalysis Framework is a human-focused gamification design framework that lays out the eight core drives for humans motivation developed by Yu-Kai Chou. The framework is based on the premise that systems are "function-focused", designed to complete a task as quickly as possible, similar to a factory process assuming workers will complete their tasks in a timely manner because they are required to do so. However, human-focused design acknowledges that people, unlike machines in a system have feelings, insecurities, and reasons why they want or do not want to do certain things, and therefore, optimizes for their feelings, motivations, and engagement.

The framework lays out the structure for analyzing the driving forces behind human motivation. It is the process of applying the core behavior drives that motivate a user to complete a task efficiently through an interactive experience. The Octalysis framework is used in healthcare, fitness, education, training, company, and product design to increase user engagement, ROI and motivation.
