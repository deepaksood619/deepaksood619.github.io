## Google Test

Google Testing and Mocking Framework

## Google Test(also known as gtest for e.g. the [ROS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Operating_System) environment) is a [unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) library for the [C++ programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), based on the [xUnit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit) architecture.The library is released under the BSD 3-clause license.It can be compiled for a variety of [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) and [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) platforms, allowing unit-testing of C sources as well as C++ with minimal source modification. The tests themselves could be run one at a time, or even be called to run all at once. This makes the debugging process very specific and caters to the need of many programmers and coders alike
