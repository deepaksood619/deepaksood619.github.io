# Post Quantum Cryptography

Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is the development of cryptographic algorithms that are resistant to attacks from quantum computers. It's also known as quantum-proof, quantum-safe, or quantum-resistant.

PQC algorithms are usually public-key algorithms. They rely on mathematical problems that are thought to be difficult for quantum computers to solve. 

Some classes of PQC systems include: 

- Hash-based
- Code based
- Lattice-based
- Multivariate quadratic equations
- Secret key cryptography
