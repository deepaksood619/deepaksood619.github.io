# Post Quantum Cryptography

Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is the development of cryptographic algorithms that are resistant to attacks from quantum computers. It's also known as quantum-proof, quantum-safe, or quantum-resistant.

PQC algorithms are usually public-key algorithms. They rely on mathematical problems that are thought to be difficult for quantum computers to solve.

Some classes of PQC systems include:

1. **Lattice-based cryptography:** This approach relies on the hardness of certain problems associated with lattices, which are mathematical structures. - [Lattice-based cryptography: The tricky math of dots - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDdOoYdb748&ab_channel=ChalkTalk)

2. **Hash-based cryptography:** This involves using hash functions to achieve secure digital signatures, key exchange, and other cryptographic functionalities.

3. **Code-based cryptography:** It leverages the hardness of decoding random linear codes to achieve security.

4. **Multivariate polynomial cryptography:** This approach uses the difficulty of solving systems of multivariate polynomial equations for cryptographic purposes.

5. **Isogeny-based cryptography:** It utilizes the difficulty of finding isogenies between elliptic curves for key exchange and other cryptographic tasks.

6. **Symmetric-key post-quantum cryptography:** This involves developing quantum-resistant symmetric-key encryption and authentication algorithms.

### Dilithium

Dilithium is a digital signature scheme that is strongly secure under chosen message attacks based on the hardness of lattice problems over module lattices. The security notion means that an adversary having access to a signing oracle cannot produce a signature of a message whose signature he hasn't yet seen, nor produce a different signature of a message that he already saw signed. Dilithium is one of the candidate algorithms submitted to the [NIST post-quantum cryptography project](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Post-Quantum-Cryptography).

## Quantum key distribution

**Quantum key distribution** (**QKD**) is a [secure communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_communication "Secure communication") method that implements a [cryptographic protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_protocol "Cryptographic protocol") involving components of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"). It enables two parties to produce a shared [random](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness "Randomness") secret [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(cryptography) "Key (cryptography)") known only to them, which then can be used to encrypt and decrypt [messages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messages "Messages"). The process of quantum key distribution is not to be confused with [quantum cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_cryptography "Quantum cryptography"), as it is the best-known example of a quantum-cryptographic task.
