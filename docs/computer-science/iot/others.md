## CE - Accurate Indoor Location for the IoT (Jan 19)

802.11b - Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI)

- Due to multipath fading, the RSSI fall-off from the antenna does not follow a uniform inverse square law and is distorted by the building materials that it travels through.
- Large errors of 10 to 20 meters

## P2PLoc for Group-Motion Applications

P2PLoc (peer-to-peer localization) envisions wearable IoT devices on users' arms or wrists that exchange wireless messages to ultimately compute the relative positions of each group member. The outcome is a topology or configuration of mo- bile users that can be tracked in real time.

Using the time wireless signals take to travel between two devices as a measure of the distance between them. The precision of this time measurement directly correlates with the bandwidth of the wireless signal used. Therefore, we use ultra-wideband (UWB) radios with a 1 GHz bandwidth. When used with a packet-handshake protocol called two-way ranging (TWR), today's UWB platforms can estimate the distance between two devices with about 10 cm precision without clock synchronization.
