## Functional Decomposition

Functional decomposition is a term that engineers use to describea set of steps in which they break down the overall function of a device, system, or process into its smaller parts. A function is simply a task that is performed by a device, system, or process. Decomposition is a process of breaking down.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_decomposition- The [Database per Service pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/database-per-service.html) describes how each service has its own database in order to ensure loose coupling.

- The [API Gateway pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html) defines how clients access the services in a microservice architecture.
- The [Client-side Discovery](https://microservices.io/patterns/client-side-discovery.html) and [Server-side Discovery](https://microservices.io/patterns/server-side-discovery.html) patterns are used to route requests for a client to an available service instance in a microservice architecture.
- The Messaging and Remote Procedure Invocation patterns are two different ways that services can communicate.
- The [Single Service per Host](https://microservices.io/patterns/deployment/single-service-per-host.html) and [Multiple Services per Host](https://microservices.io/patterns/deployment/multiple-services-per-host.html) patterns are two different deployment strategies.
- Cross-cutting concerns patterns:[Microservice chassis pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/microservice-chassis.html) and [Externalized configuration](https://microservices.io/patterns/externalized-configuration.html)
- Testing patterns:[Service Component Test](https://microservices.io/patterns/testing/service-component-test.html) and [Service Integration Contract Test](https://microservices.io/patterns/testing/service-integration-contract-test.html)
- [Circuit Breaker](https://microservices.io/patterns/reliability/circuit-breaker.html)
- [Access Token](https://microservices.io/patterns/security/access-token.html)
- Observability patterns:
    - [Log aggregation](https://microservices.io/patterns/observability/application-logging.html)
    - [Application metrics](https://microservices.io/patterns/observability/application-metrics.html)
    - [Audit logging](https://microservices.io/patterns/observability/audit-logging.html)
    - [Distributed tracing](https://microservices.io/patterns/observability/distributed-tracing.html)
    - [Exception tracking](https://microservices.io/patterns/observability/exception-tracking.html)

    - [Log deployments and changes](https://microservices.io/patterns/observability/log-deployments-and-changes.html)
- UI patterns:
    - [Server-side page fragment composition](https://microservices.io/patterns/ui/server-side-page-fragment-composition.html)
    - [Client-side UI composition](https://microservices.io/patterns/ui/client-side-ui-composition.html)

## Self Contained System (SCS)

The Self-contained System (SCS) approach is an architecture that focuses on a separation of the functionality into many independent systems, making the complete logical system a collaboration of many smaller software systems. This avoids the problem of large monoliths that grow constantly and eventually become unmaintainable.
