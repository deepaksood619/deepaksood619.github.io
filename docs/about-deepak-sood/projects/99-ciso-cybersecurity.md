# CISO Cybersecurity

- Implemented face detection using Viola-Jones Algorithm, corner detection using fixed points, Live Video Streaming using ffmpeg with scripting in python and product development using Java, Spring and Java-FX
- Stack: MySQL, Redis, Java, Spring, Python, REST

Worked on core product development team, as a java developer and find novel solutions for any problems faced by the team during development. Worked focused on mainly on Media Streaming, Image Processing and have worked on full SDLC.

Worked on core and advance java, face detection using Viola-Jones Algorithm, corner detection using fixed points, Live Video Streaming using ffmpeg.

Products - Testpad, Proctor and Test Engine (nodejs, MSS and MS)

### Digiproctor / DigiInABox / Testpad / Proctor / MSS(Media Streaming Server) / MS (Media Web Server)

Digiproctor: Test Management Platform with Live Proctoring

CISO Cybersecurity Pvt. Ltd.

Used ffmpeg to stream live video capture of both screen and webcam over UDP for remote proctoring with all the streams recorded and archived.

### FFMPEG live streaming of videos from candidates to proctor

- Used ffmpeg to stream from 100s of system to centralized server i.e. proctor, so everyone can be monitored remotely
- Optimized further the live streaming, using multiple compression techniques and different parameters in ffmpeg to fine tune the streaming, to get maximum number of parallel connections with maximum utilization of resources of cpu and memory
- Overlay photo and video on another stream
- Video Flip

### Face detection and alerting

Automatic face detection using Viola-Jones Algorithm, corner detection using fixed points, for automatically proctoring of the candidates, and sending them automatic alerts to move back inside frame or when multiple faces were detected

### Packaging applications for different devices

- Packaging the code to run on different architectures - linux, windows and macbook
- Since applications was on-premise systems, code was obfuscated using proguard, yguard to make it harder to decompile
- Code encryption (jasypt, java simplified encryption)
- Advanced Installer (auto updater, configuration files, creating builds)
- Installer for MAC
- Jar signing with code signing certificates

### Real time chat using java sockets implementation

- Chats can be initiated either from proctors or candidates, for a full duplex real time chat experience
- Java sockets implementation was used for the same

### Using JavaFx to create frontend for desktop application

- Whole desktop application was created using javafx, and made responsive using containers to make sure that application can run on various devices of various sizes
- Responsive FXML design

### POC - WebRTC implementation for directly using chrome browsers as testpads

- Setup STUN and TURN servers for doing peer-to-peer webrtc streaming

### Database maintenance and seeding

- Country, State, City Populate

### Others

- jd (java decompiler)
- PC Resource Check and sanitization
    - System lockdown
- Hybrid Mobile Application using Ionic Framework
- Digi in a box
- Terminate, random 360, Id decline, Pause
- Storing media alerts in database
- Proctor initiated Id auth and 360
- Streaming unlimited loop if camera not present
- System lockdown integration
- Timer in test instructions
- System status checks
- Stats generation for Testpad media files
