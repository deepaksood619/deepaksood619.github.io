## Fees

### Switching Fee

While you swipe a card (probably within seconds) there’s a lot that happens at the back end. Out of it, one thing is, the card-issuing institution (VISA, Mastercard, AMEX etc.) levying a processing fee to card’s issuing bank (HDFC, AXIS, ICICI, SBI etc.)

This fee is what we call Switching Fee in the payment ecosystem. This fee can be called as the routing transaction fee between both the bodies and varies from 0.15% to 1.00%.

### Interchange Fee

An interchange fee is an amount that the issuing institutions collect from the acquiring bank. Usually, this fee is a percentage of the total transaction plus a fixed amount. And while the issuing institutions collect, assess and set this fee, they are paid to the issuing bank, who issue a particular card.

Please note that the average interchange rate for a credit card is around 1.81% and for debit cards, it’s 0.3%.

### Payment Service Provider Fee (PSP Fee)

A Payment Service Provider or a PSP is usually a SaaS-based enabler that acts as an aggregator between businesses and the end customer.
