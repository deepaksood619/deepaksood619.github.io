# Techie Talks Podcast - Architecting Data at Scale

Hi Deepak,  
  
Thank you for agreeing to join me on the show. Your deep experience in data engineering and scaling complex systems is a topic our audience will find incredibly valuable.  
  
This document outlines the planned flow for our 30-minute conversation. Please use it as a guide to prepare. The goal is a natural, insightful discussion, so please feel free to share personal stories and project examples.  
  
Looking forward to our conversation! - Kuldeep

## Part 1: The Data Engineer's Mindset (Approx. 8 mins)

Kuldeep's Question: Welcome, Deepak! With over 8 years of experience, you've seen a lot. How would you describe the core role of a modern data engineer, and how has that role evolved over your career?

**Talking Points for You:**

- Moving beyond just building pipelines to designing scalable, efficient data ecosystems.
- The importance of leading multi-disciplinary teams (dev, ops, data science).
- How you balance hands-on engineering with high-level system design.

## Part 2: Deep Dive: Architecture for Speed & Scale (Approx. 12 mins)

Kuldeep's Question: Your profile mentions using microservices, GraphQL, and Kafka to enhance development speed and flexibility. Can you walk us through a project where this combination was critical? What problem were you solving?

**Talking Points for You:**

- Set the stage: Describe the business challenge or the system you needed to scale.
- Explain how each technology played its part (e.g., Kafka for data streaming, microservices for independent deployment, GraphQL for efficient data fetching).
- The "before and after" impact: How did this architecture improve things?

Kuldeep's Question: On the infrastructure side, you have expertise in tools like Elasticsearch, Prometheus, and Kubernetes. How do these tools support the data-intensive applications you build?

**Talking Points for You:**

- The role of Kubernetes in managing and scaling your microservices.
- How you use Elasticsearch for search and analytics on large datasets.
- Why Prometheus is crucial for monitoring these complex, distributed systems to ensure reliability.

## Part 3: Leadership & Final Advice (Approx. 10 mins)

Kuldeep's Question: You're passionate about mentoring and coaching. What's your approach to leading technical teams, especially when working with multiple stakeholders?

**Talking Points for You:**

- The importance of strong communication skills in translating technical concepts to business stakeholders.
- How you foster a culture of learning and growth within your teams.
- A key lesson you've learned about effective technical leadership.

Kuldeep's Question: Finally, what is one piece of advice for engineers who want to specialize in data engineering and eventually lead teams as you do?

**Talking Points for You:**

- The need to understand the full data lifecycle, not just one tool.
- Why developing business acumen is just as important as technical skill.
- A final key takeaway for building a successful career in this field.
