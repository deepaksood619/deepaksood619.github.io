# Freecharge - Cost Optimization and Database Administration

## Client Overview

- **Client:** Freecharge
- **Industry:** Financial Services
- **Objective:** Reduce AWS costs, enhance infrastructure manageability, and automate manual tasks.
- Initial AWS Monthly Costs - $150,000
- Optimized AWS Monthly Costs - $110,000

## Approach

### 1. Infrastructure Assessment

We conducted a detailed assessment of Freecharge's AWS infrastructure to identify inefficiencies and potential cost-saving opportunities. This involved analyzing compute resources, storage, database configurations, and service utilization.

### 2. DevOps Optimization

#### a. S3 Optimization

We optimized S3 storage by:

- Identifying and deleting unused objects.
- Implementing lifecycle policies to transition infrequently accessed data to cheaper storage classes (e.g., S3 Infrequent Access, Glacier).
- Enabling versioning and cleanup policies to manage old versions.

#### b. EC2 Instance Right-Sizing and Upgrading

- Right-sized EC2 instances to better match workload requirements, ensuring optimal resource utilization.
- Migrated instances from older Intel-based instances to newer AMD and Graviton instances, achieving better performance at a lower cost.

#### c. Cleanup of Unused Resources

- Conducted thorough cleanups of unused resources across multiple environments and accounts, including unattached EBS volumes, obsolete snapshots, and unused Elastic IPs.

#### d. Load Balancer Merging

- Merged redundant load balancers to streamline traffic management and reduce associated costs.

### 3. Database Optimization and Administration

#### a. RDS and EC2 Database Merging

- Consolidated 80 databases, moving from 50 on EC2 to a combination of RDS and Aurora.
- Merged smaller databases into larger instances where appropriate to improve manageability and reduce overhead.

#### b. Archival and Rightsizing

- Implemented data archival strategies to move historical data to cheaper storage solutions, reducing active database size and costs.
- Right-sized database instances based on actual usage patterns to optimize cost and performance.

#### c. Database Migration

- Migrated databases between EC2 and RDS/Aurora based on availability and performance requirements.
- Set up replication, disaster recovery (DR), and backup strategies to ensure data availability and resilience.

#### d. Upgrading Databases

- Upgraded databases from MySQL 5.7 to 8.0, reducing extended support costs.
- Used blue-green deployment strategies to minimize downtime during upgrades.

#### e. Cost Reduction for Backups and DynamoDB

- Optimized backup strategies to reduce storage costs.
- Implemented DynamoDB reserved instances (RIs) to lower costs.

### 4. Additional Activities

#### a. Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) and Backup Monitoring

- Implemented DAM to monitor and log database activities, enhancing security and compliance.
- Set up comprehensive backup monitoring to ensure regular and reliable backups.

#### b. Savings Plans and Reserved Instances

- Purchased savings plans for EC2 instances to secure long-term cost reductions.
- Implemented RIs for DynamoDB and RDS to take advantage of significant savings over on-demand pricing.

#### c. Cost Accelerator Mails

- Set up automated cost accelerator emails for daily monitoring of AWS expenditures, ensuring timely identification and addressing of any cost anomalies.

## Results

### Cost Savings

- **Initial Monthly Cost:** $150,000
- **Optimized Monthly Cost:** $110,000
- **Total Monthly Savings:** $40,000 (approx. 27% reduction)

### Infrastructure Manageability

- Reduced infrastructure footprint by eliminating unused resources and consolidating databases.
- Enhanced infrastructure manageability through automation of routine tasks and improved monitoring.

### Performance and Reliability

- Improved database performance and reliability through optimized configurations, rightsizing, and migration strategies.
- Achieved zero downtime during database upgrades and migrations using blue-green deployment and replication setups.

## Conclusion

Through strategic optimizations on both the DevOps and DBA sides, Opstree successfully reduced Freecharge's AWS costs by approximately 27%, while significantly enhancing infrastructure manageability and automating manual tasks. This case study underscores Opstree's ability to deliver cost-effective, high-performance solutions tailored to client needs.
