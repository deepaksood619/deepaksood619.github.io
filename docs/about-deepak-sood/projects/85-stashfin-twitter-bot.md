With a growing customer base, managing inquiries and complaints effectively became crucial to maintaining customer satisfaction. To address this challenge, Stashfin embarked on implementing a Twitter bot for social media customer support.

### Objective

The primary objective was to streamline the process of addressing customer queries and complaints on Twitter by leveraging automation. The Twitter bot aimed to improve response times, provide accurate assistance, and enhance overall customer experience.

### Implementation

For complaints, the bot automatically generated a ticket and assigned it to a customer support agent for further resolution.

5. **End-to-End Testing:** Before deployment, the Twitter bot underwent rigorous testing to ensure its functionality, accuracy, and responsiveness. End-to-end testing simulated various scenarios to validate the bot's ability to handle different types of queries and complaints effectively.

6. **Deployment:** Once testing was completed successfully, the Twitter bot was deployed to actively monitor Stashfin's Twitter account and engage with users in real-time.
