# On-Premise MLOps Platform

This document outlines the architecture and components of an on-premise MLOps platform for a cell detection system. The platform is designed to enable multiple users to train, tune, and deploy machine learning (ML) models securely and efficiently using a shared dataset. The architecture supports secure isolation for users, incorporates guardrails for compliance and right resource usage, and leverages state-of-the-art tools and technologies to ensure scalability and performance.

## High-Level Requirements

1. **User Isolation**: Each user operates in an isolated environment.
2. **Dataset Sharing**: A central repository for a shared dataset of 1000-2000 human cell images.
3. **Scalability**: Horizontally scalable infrastructure to accommodate up to 8-10 users per system.
4. **GPU Support**: CUDA-enabled GPUs for efficient training and hyperparameter tuning.
5. **Security**: VPN access, role-based access controls (RBAC), and data encryption.
6. **MLOps Features**:
    - Experiment tracking
    - Model management and repository
    - Automated hyperparameter tuning
    - Workflow orchestration
7. **On-Premise Deployment**: Ensures compliance with local data privacy and security requirements.
