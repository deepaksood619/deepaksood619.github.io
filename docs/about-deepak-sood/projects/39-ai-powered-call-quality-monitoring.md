	2. Transcriptions are stored in S3 for further processing.
3. **Processing Pipeline**
	1. AWS Glue processes transcripts and audio metadata.
	2. Sentiment analysis and entity detection are performed using Amazon Comprehend.
	3. Custom categorization is applied based on business rules.
4. **Storage**
	1. Processed data is stored in Amazon RDS or DynamoDB for structured queries.
	2. Elasticsearch or OpenSearch is used for indexing and search.
5. **Analytics & Reporting**
	1. Amazon QuickSight provides dashboards for real-time monitoring.
	2. Reports can be exported to PDF or CSV formats.

## Call Transcribing

"Call transcribing" refers to the process of converting a recorded phone conversation into written text, while "quality assurance" in this context means the practice of reviewing those transcribed calls to ensure accuracy and adherence to quality standards, often used to evaluate customer service interactions and agent performance within a company.

Key points about call transcribing and quality assurance:

### Purpose

Companies often record customer service calls for quality assurance, which involves transcribing the conversation to review details like agent responses, issue resolution, and adherence to company policies.

### Benefits

- **Agent training:** Transcripts can be used to identify areas where agents need improvement in communication skills or product knowledge.
- **Customer experience evaluation:** Analyzing transcripts allows companies to assess customer satisfaction and identify potential issues.
- **Compliance checks:** In industries with strict regulations, call transcripts can be used to verify compliance with legal requirements.

### Quality assurance process

- **Sampling:** A representative sample of calls is selected for transcription.
- **Transcription:** The audio is converted into written text, ensuring accuracy and capturing key details like pauses and tone of voice.
- **Review and evaluation:** Quality assurance specialists review the transcripts against established criteria, assessing aspects like agent greetings, problem-solving techniques, and overall professionalism.
