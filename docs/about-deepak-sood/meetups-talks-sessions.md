## Build apps for Google Chat with Gemini (7 March 2025)

- Build with AI: Ghaziabad Edition - NITRA Technical Campus, Ghaziabad

Presentation - [NITRA - Zero to Hero: Mastering GenAI in a Flash - Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rmT_p4wagioys1iNRlEuCYdIRZO89CZEYwoODmi-iWs/edit?usp=sharing)

Build a Patent Search App with AlloyDB, Vector Search & Vertex AI!

1. Create an AlloyDB instance and load Patents Public Dataset data
2. Enable pgvector and generative AI model extensions in AlloyDB
3. Generate embeddings from the insights
4. Perform real time Cosine similarity search for user search text
5. Deploy the solution in serverless Cloud Functions

Google Chat apps with Gemini do the following:

- Bring your services and resources into Google Chat, which lets users get information and take action without leaving the conversation.
- Integrate with the generative AI model Gemini, so they can create or search data like text or images at specific times to streamline your workflows.

![Build Apps for Google Chat with Gemini](../media/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-03-01%20at%2023.22.59.jpeg)

### Why integrate Google Chat apps with Gemini?

The typical use cases of Generative AI models like Gemini fall in the following categories:

- **Content creation and enhancement**. Generate marketing copy, craft social media posts, create realistic images, compose music, or aid in the creation of video content.
- **Data search**. Extract key insights from an unstructured knowledge base, summarize lengthy texts, classify contents, or translate languages with enhanced accuracy and speed.
- **Conversation**. Engage in natural, informative, and creative conversations.

### What you build

In this codelab, you build three Google Chat apps with Gemini to cover the three use cases introduced in the previous section.

1. Issue management app (content creation and enhancement)
2. Knowledge app (data search)
3. Feedback app (conversation)

### What you learn

- How to integrate Google Chat apps with Gemini through Vertex AI.
- How to integrate Google Chat apps with Dialogflow CX agents.
- How to use the latest features of Google Chat: app home, Google Chat Events, and accessory widgets.
