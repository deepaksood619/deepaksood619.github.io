## SRE - Gameday - Hackathon - Opstree, Noida (10 May 2025)

The SRE Gameday is an interactive, hands-on event designed to simulate real-world production incidents, challenging teams to diagnose and resolve issues using observability tools and Kubernetes access. Participants will respond to system alerts and user complaints delivered via dedicated Slack channels, identifying root causes for issues such as high error rates and slow response times. With around 8–10 genuine problems hidden among numerous alerts, teams must work strategically, analyze symptoms, distinguish duplicates, and submit comprehensive root cause analyses. This gameday fosters collaboration, real-time problem-solving, and strengthens site reliability engineering practices in a high-pressure, realistic environment.

Presentation - [NITRA - Zero to Hero: Mastering GenAI in a Flash - Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rmT_p4wagioys1iNRlEuCYdIRZO89CZEYwoODmi-iWs/edit?usp=sharing)

Build a Patent Search App with AlloyDB, Vector Search & Vertex AI!

1. Create an AlloyDB instance and load Patents Public Dataset data
2. Enable pgvector and generative AI model extensions in AlloyDB
3. Generate embeddings from the insights
4. Perform real time Cosine similarity search for user search text
5. Deploy the solution in serverless Cloud Functions

Google Chat apps with Gemini do the following:

- Bring your services and resources into Google Chat, which lets users get information and take action without leaving the conversation.
- Integrate with the generative AI model Gemini, so they can create or search data like text or images at specific times to streamline your workflows.

![Build Apps for Google Chat with Gemini](../media/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-03-01%20at%2023.22.59.jpeg)

### Why integrate Google Chat apps with Gemini?

The typical use cases of Generative AI models like Gemini fall in the following categories:

- **Content creation and enhancement**. Generate marketing copy, craft social media posts, create realistic images, compose music, or aid in the creation of video content.
- **Data search**. Extract key insights from an unstructured knowledge base, summarize lengthy texts, classify contents, or translate languages with enhanced accuracy and speed.
- **Conversation**. Engage in natural, informative, and creative conversations.

### What you build

In this codelab, you build three Google Chat apps with Gemini to cover the three use cases introduced in the previous section.

1. Issue management app (content creation and enhancement)
2. Knowledge app (data search)
3. Feedback app (conversation)

### What you learn

- How to integrate Google Chat apps with Gemini through Vertex AI.
- How to integrate Google Chat apps with Dialogflow CX agents.
- How to use the latest features of Google Chat: app home, Google Chat Events, and accessory widgets.

### Microsoft MVP

To become a Microsoft MVP, you must be nominated by a current MVP or Microsoft employee and have a history of outstanding community contributions in the past 12 months, such as technical blogging, public speaking, and helping others in online forums. You need to be an individual (not an organization), at least 18 years old, and not a Microsoft employee, contractor, or government agency worker. The key is to share your expertise and impact the community, focusing on a specific Microsoft technology area to build your reputation as a community influencer.  

Key Steps to Becoming a Microsoft MVP

1. **Focus on a Microsoft Technology:** Choose a specific area within Microsoft's technology ecosystem (like Microsoft Azure, Microsoft 365, or Developer Technology) that you are passionate about and have deep expertise in.
2. **Become a Community Influencer:** Share your knowledge and passion by:
	- **Blogging and Content Creation:** Write technical blogs, create videos, or publish articles and books to share your insights and learnings.
	- **Public Speaking:** Speak at conferences, user groups, and other events to share your expertise with a wider audience.
	- **Community Engagement:** Actively participate in forums, answer questions, and contribute to open-source projects related to your chosen Microsoft technology.
	- **Network:** Engage with Microsoft employees and existing MVPs to build relationships within the community.
3. **Track Your Contributions:** Maintain a record of your activities over the last 12 months, documenting the type of contribution (blog, presentation, etc.), the topic, and the number of attendees or viewers, as this information is crucial for the nomination process.
4. **Receive a Nomination:** You must be nominated for the award by a current Microsoft MVP or a Microsoft employee.
5. **Fulfill Eligibility Criteria:** Ensure you meet the basic requirements:
	- Be at least 18 years old.
	- Be an individual, not an organization.
	- Not be a current Microsoft employee, contractor, or worker for a government agency.
6. **Acknowledge the Program Agreement:** Upon nomination, you will need to acknowledge and agree to the Microsoft MVP Program agreement.
7. **Maintain Consistency and Professionalism:** The award is based on community impact over a 12-month rolling period. You must conduct yourself professionally and be consistent in your contributions to maintain the award.
