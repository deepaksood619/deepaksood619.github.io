Conscious capitalism

Japanese spirit is the most important quality in their people instead of Indian complacency

tit-for-tat strategy comes from game theory. The essence is:

**"Do onto others as they do onto you"**

1. On the first move, cooperate
2. On each succeeding move do what your opponent did the previous move
3. Be prepared to forgive after carrying out just one act of retaliation

The greatest fulfilment in life is to do something which is much larger than yourself. -- Sadhguru

- Work is workship
- For me means are more important than the end
- I don't believe in weekends
- Ownership
- Lead by Example
- Not capitalistic
- **Minimalism**
- More is not always better
- I am a slow walker but I never walk backwards

## Family Values

- Honesty
- Standing for others

## Skeptical

I'm a highly skeptical person. People are simply not always genuine. Nor do people have all the answers. There are many examples of that. I recently read about a German/Dutch guy who inspired others to overcome depression.

He once tried to commit suicide and in his attempt, he lost his legs. After that, he saw the light, wrote two books about how he "overcame" depression and started preaching the gospel.

Last month, he killed [himself](https://nos.nl/l/2301435).

It's sad. And I'm not questioning his legacy. Maybe he truly helped others. But we have to be honest here, the guy who talked others out of suicide, took his own life.

That's why we should NEVER idolize people. Putting people on a pedestal means you don't respect yourself. Here's the thing: no matter what your background, race, or gender - no one is better than you.

Also, you're not better than others. That's how I look at life. And that's also why I don't believe what I see. People lie all the time to show they are better than others.

## Thrifty

In the journey of life, my wife and I have found a guiding principle that shapes our every step: each day could be our last in our current circumstances. This doesn't inspire a frenzied rush, but a simple realization that our jobs are not guaranteed.

This belief has been our beacon, guiding us through calm and storm alike. When jobs were abundant and salaries high, we held onto this principle. It influenced our financial decisions and priorities. We chose simplicity, spending less than we earned - a lifestyle my wife aptly called "living below our means." While others invested in homes during the 2021-22 boom, we resisted, despite the discomfort.

We could have afforded a house. Our salaries would have allowed it. But we sought safety over excess. Our goal was to save enough to sustain ourselves and our dependents for at least five years if we both lost our jobs. That's why we live in a rented apartment, mindful of our rent. If we lose our jobs, we don't want the added stress of relocating due to high costs.

In the past 13 years, this approach to money meant we've taken zero self-funded international vacation together. I share this as a gentle reminder to those enjoying a good income right now.

We don't have the luxury of job security, like our parents did. Today, I see many talented individuals earning great salaries. But it's easy to forget that things can change. Salaries don't always rise, and life isn't always smooth. Illness, loss, and tough times can hit anyone. While emotional strength is crucial, financial security is equally important.

This isn't financial advice or a hardship story, at best it's probably a miser's point of view towards life ðŸ™ˆ . I think it's a a decision-making framework that has guided me well so I thought I should share ðŸ˜‡
