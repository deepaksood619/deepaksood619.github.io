# Thoughts / Future / Ideas / Vision / Prediction

1. Over time people will reduce reading books (Books will die)
2. Diversity among humans will decrease, and everything will become standardized
3. Travelling will reduce among western countries due to high temperature and climate change negative effects. People will be in home more and in-home entertainment and software will soar.
4. Future the land prices in highly dense environment will go down because people will start moving to rural areas when flying taxis are invented. People's range while traveling will increase given the same amount of time, from current 10 kms in a car to 100 kms in a flying taxi in same 10 mins.
5. Robotics, AI and flying taxis will significantly change the world, so it's better to move out of India, after babies since a huge population will be a bane instead of boom
6. Text and Writing is not a very good type of communication for humans, Humans love voice based communication, so AI LLM will reinvent everything. Humans will learn by talking and voice assistants will write and reply everything in real time.
	1. You can talk 3x faster than you can type.

### Breakthroughs

#### Memristor

What they have done essentially is to develop a type of semiconductor device called Memristor, but using a metal-organic film rather than conventional silicon-based technology. This material enables the Memristor to mimic the way the biological brain processes information using networks of neurons and synapses, rather than do it the way digital computers do.

…The Memristor, when integrated with a conventional digital computer, enhances its energy and speed performance by hundreds of times, thus becoming an extremely energy-efficient ‘AI accelerator’.…When eventually scaled up, the technology could enable the most large-scale and complex AI tasks – such as large language model (LLM) training – to be done on a laptop or smartphone, rather than requiring a data centre.

## Thoughts

We are highly unqualified to speak anything about anything that we are not working in, therefore we should speak about facts rather than opinions

God is the Creator, not a manager. Humans have the privilege of managing their own lives.

The world's economic incentive is not good enough for humans and creating equal opportunity and a better place

Blockchain and smart contract reinvents trust and solve lies/frauds mathematically.

Blockchain reinvents trust.

Humans cannot be trusted, they trust software more than other humans - Haven't you studied past history as to what humans have done to other humans.

In long term for a company to survive, stock ownership for employees and board of directors, to keep each other in check, works. Otherwise leaders will never take ownership, since it's not their company and owners/founders will have to keep other leaders in check. Otherwise company will slowly collapse.

The whole world is moving towards electric, but India is pushing more towards Hydrogen why? Maybe they want everyone to be dependent on government and their big corporations rather than becoming independent.

## Top changes

1. We will be capable of having (subject to no political barriers) Al-based near free doctors, lawyers and tutors for every citizen of the planet that will amplify our human professionals to improve accessibility and care.
2. We could have more efficient sources of plant protein to replace animal protein and much better fertilizer.
3. We could replace the majority of cars in most cities
4. In 15 years we could have flying Mach 5 planes that get us from NYC to London in 90 minutes - on sustainable aviation fuel no less
5. In 25 years there could be a billion bipedal robots (a million in 10 years). This would create a new industry larger than the current auto industry. From factory workers to farm workers and more, we could free humans from the bottom 50% of really undesirable jobs. You'd have yours, I'd have mine - and it'll totally change how we interact with the physical world.
6. There could be a billion programmers all "programming" in natural language. The "craft" of coding would be commoditised and the entire field would be opened up to those without the classic CS degree. Just one of innumerable examples of how entire industries could be shaken up.
7. A world where we can discover more resources than we consume in the next few decades.
8. We could replace all coal plants by 2050. My bet is on fusion.
9. Music and entertainment could be plentiful, and personalised. Content creation would be commoditized, but it is not going to change the celebrity-consumer relationship. That "phenomenon" would still exist as a different experience.
10. Carbon emissions could be a smaller issue (though still an issue) if we get the will to find and scale better technologies for cement, steel, agriculture, transportation, power production, HVAC, etc. Most such efforts will fail but enough will succeed to solve the problem of carbon emissions in the critical areas.

### Mobility

#### Self Driving Car

Self driving car is the future of transportation and I want to contribute to one of the biggest problem that humanity is facing by solving deaths by vehicles by removing all the deaths caused by human errors. Also Earth cannot support 11 billion privately owned cars, so ride sharing is going to solve that problem. Better communication between vehicles, intelligent routing, better vision and better understanding of roads are huge problems that must be solved in coming decade and I want to contribute to that.

#### Flying Cars

But flying cars with autonomous flight capacity can democratise that too, so people don't have to live in a dense area. Since right now can reach 10km in 10 mins, but with flying cars they can reach maybe 50km in 10 mins.

And ofcourse we can move from a 1D plane of travel to multi layer travel in air. All infrastructure can be reclaimed back from ground to plant more trees. Atleast between cities.

Future -
Flying taxi
Autonomous vehicle

### Other Thoughts

Is there a solar panel mafia in India, which itself can import cheap solar panels, but don't let smaller household import solar panel, so they can be energy independent. Since they want to rule other human beings, and keep them dependent on a corporation, so they have their source of revenue.

Solar panels democratise energy, instead of a centralised source and dependency.

But for a highly dense area, solar panels at individual level doesn't make sense.

A very much problem with voice dictation is that, it beaches privacy, since others can hear what you are saying, but typing solves it, but typing is slow, so next evaluation is direct brain to text. What I am thinking can directly go to mobile or other devices i.e brain computer interface. Even a step further from one brain to others brain. That will be a leap in human communication.

Speed of thought is faster than speed of speaking which is faster than speed of writing.
Anyways writing is another set of thing that a child has to run, which he/she can skip all together. Atleast writing and typing can be skipped, and reading can stay for a bit long.
