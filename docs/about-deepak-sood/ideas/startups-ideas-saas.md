# Startups Ideas - SAAS

Create best software companies with Indian labour, since labour is cheap in India like Zoho

Problem with current SAAS pricing

- It's per user based
- It should be instead usage based, you use 1 GB storage and 1 cpu and 2 GB RAM, you pay for that exactly + some revenue

**Developer tools - pure software play**

## Finance / Economics

**Programmable currency, you can program the currency in a way that it can only be used for a certain thing like buying fertilizer by a farmer**

### Smart Credit

- Health Insurance money is paid by insurer directly to hospital (smart/programmable currency)
- Whatever credit you take is directly transfered to merchant to that purpose, it doesn't go to you, so that can give credit at lesser interest rate, like car loan, home loan
- Food Coupons, other coupons

### Regenerative Finance (ReFi)

ReFi is a beautiful idea -- a re-imagining of the financial system using the tools humanity now has at its disposal to better account for the needs of all stakeholders, current and future. It puts a price on externalities, charging those who create negative externalities (like the Once-ler) and rewarding those who create positive externalities (like the Lorax, who speaks for the trees)

ReFi seems hippie, but it isn't anti-growth or anti-progress. It's not anti anything. It's for a new financial model that includes and regenerates people as individuals with unique talents, communities as economic hubs, and the health and biodiversity of global ecosystems. Its participants want to accelerate the development of new, planet-positive technologies through better measurement and financing

That idea came from Charles Eisenstein's Sacred Economics: if you back money with more of the things you want to see in the world, you'll get more of those things

Celo is based on a belief that programmable money will unlock new economic models, and that changing the features of money (which is possible because money's just a technology) can lead to a more beautiful world. And it's a bet that mission-aligned builders will care as much about a Layer 1's community as they do its tech specs. When everything is open, liquidity has no loyalty, and each blockchain's technology continues to improve, standing for something, and building a community around it, might be a key competitive advantage in a multi-chain world

[Will RBI make money dance to its tunes?](https://finshots.in/archive/will-rbi-make-money-dance-to-its-tunes/)

Let’s say a school has given money to a student who won a prize to buy books in a particular bookshop. So the student can only use this money for that purpose.

But as soon as the book is purchased and the currency goes to the bookshop owner, it becomes fungible again.

So it’s only for that period the fungibility of money becomes limited.

If the student chooses not to spend the money, it goes back to the school and it becomes fungible again.

So programmability does not militate against fungibility but rather, just puts it on hold.
