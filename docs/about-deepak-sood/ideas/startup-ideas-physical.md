### Vertical Parking system for cars+suv

Max height for 15 cars each slot of suv height for every car fit. Height will be checked at entrance with the in time. Total money calculation can be done by subtracting the out time with in time. The parking money can be hour wise or by car weight. Can be placed at every metro. A complex with 15 car capacity per building for 5 structures will contain 75 cars. In ground are of 5 car space. Excluding the area of infrastructure around it. All steal truss structure for easy addtion and removal. Modules will be constructed independently and can be just directly placed.

### Better and Cheap Pervious Concrete

- Pervious concrete, also known as **porous concrete**, water permeable concrete, or thirsty concrete, is a type of concrete that has a high void content that allows water or air to pass through.
- Pervious concrete allows the passage of air and water, which can help preserve trees. It can also reduce stormwater runoff, which is a leading source of pollutants entering waterways.
- Researchers have found that **pervious concrete has less tensile and flexural strength than conventional concrete**. That's why it is generally not used for concrete pavements for high traffic and heavy wheel loads.

## Traffic Management

Connected traffic lights with intelligent routing system

Computer vision traffic management, single pole in mid with high mast 4 side cameras, within same poles trafic lights. Traffic light will be controlled by the amount of cars in each lane.

In a traffic signal, "VAC" stands for "**Vehicle Actuated Control**," meaning the traffic light automatically adjusts its timing based on the presence of vehicles detected at the intersection, essentially giving a green light only when a car is waiting to proceed.

**Key points about VAC**

- **Adaptive system:** VAC is considered an adaptive traffic control system, responding to real-time traffic conditions.
- **Vehicle detection sensors:** These sensors detect the presence of vehicles and trigger the signal change.
- **Efficiency in moderate traffic:** VAC is often most effective in situations with moderate traffic flow.
