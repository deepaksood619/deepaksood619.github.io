The son is rushed to the ER. The attending surgeon looks at the boy and says, 'I can't operate on this boy. He's my son! ' How can this be?"

Fifty years after the riddle first received public attention, one likely answer proves elusive: the surgeon is the boy's mother.

### Gender and sex

"Sex" refers to the physical differences between people who are male, female, or [intersex](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/gender-identity/sex-gender-identity/whats-intersex). A person typically has their sex assigned at birth based on physiological characteristics, including their genitalia and chromosome composition. This assigned sex is called a personâ€™s "natal sex."

Gender, on the other hand, involves how a person identifies. Unlike natal sex, gender is not made up of binary forms. Instead, gender is a broad spectrum. A person may identify at any point within this spectrum or outside of it entirely.

#### cisgender

Someone who identifies with the gender that they were assigned at birth is called "cisgender."

Someone who is not cisgender and does not identify within the gender binary - of man or woman, boy or girl - may identify as nonbinary, genderfluid, or genderqueer, among other identities.

A person whose gender identity is different from their natal sex might identify as transgender.
