## Founders / Entrepreneurship

Two types of founders. Mercenary and missionary.

### Mercenary

Former are the ones who see a gap in the market and attack it. Shoe laces to ball bearings to plastic scoops - as long as there is a better way to serve the market, a market that already exists, they are in.

Usually, these are the guys who build profitable companies. Why?

Because they start with how the world is. Not how it should be. They meet the consumer where she stands today. And serve her needs.

### Missionary

Missionary founders are the opposite of mercenary in almost every way.

We see how (a certain part of) the world is, and we don’t like it. We want to change it.

We don’t go where the consumer is. We try and get her to where we believe she should be (how presumptuous).

And we usually don’t make money. Neither do our companies. Why?

Because we try and play God. We refuse to accept reality. We want to change it. Last I checked, reality remains unbeaten.

Change begets friction. This, according to me, is why so many purpose led businesses remain small.

**Oligopoly**

An oligopoly is a [market form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_structure) where in a [market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_(economics)) or [industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_(economics)) is dominated by a small group of large sellers (oligopolists). For example, it has been found out that insulin and the electrical industry are highly oligopolist in the US.

combine digital and physical

**Attention Economy -** Apps such as Facebook, Youtube that want to increase the time spent on their app... They are generally solving for entertainment or allowing self-expression. Their north star of these apps revolves around maximizing time spent by customers on the app. Think Spotify, Netflix, PubG, Tiktok etc.

**Transactions Economy -** Apps such as Amazon, Uber or any marketplace or platform that help make purchase decisions quickly. Here time spent is vanity, they focus on utility and fulfillment by increasing the number of transactions on the platform. Think Gpay, Swiggy, or any online retail company etc

**Productivity Economy -** Apps or products such as Slack, Trello, Microsoft Office, or most SAAS software that are working hard to improve your efficiency at work. Their key goals will revolve around solving a core problem and these measure success through usage, not time spent. Think Zoho, Adobe, Evernote, etc..

- Sexiness
- How Solved the Problem Already Is

- In the early stages, investors don't care about month-over-month growth
- Instead,for early-stage B2B businesses, investors focus on how quickly they ramp to $1m ARR after going live
- Along those same lines, for early-stage consumer businesses, it's all about intensity of engagement, virality, and retention - not revenue

## Discovery Commerce Platform (e-commerce)

Discovery commerce is an online sales method based on guiding the buyer towards a product.

Discovery shopping, on the other hand, is where **a user visits websites or marketplaces without a defined purpose**. This buyer isn’t looking for a specific product, but is open to being pleasantly surprised by exploring an online catalog or receiving suggestions.

Discovery commerce is the equivalent of 'I'm feeling lucky' in Google searches. While the main effort of an ecommerce strategy is aimed at efficiently meeting specific needs of the consumer, discovery commerce draws on the custom of strolling through a store, browsing shelves without intention to buy... until the perfect product catches your eye.
