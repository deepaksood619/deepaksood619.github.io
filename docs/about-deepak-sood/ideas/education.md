- [linkedin.com/in/maheshwer-peri-1723ba3b/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maheshwer-peri-1723ba3b/)
- former president and publisher of the Outlook group
- I am a dreamer. I dream of an equal world. A fair world. A world where every one has equal opportunities and a fair shot at fame. A world that is rational, questioning and has heaps of scientific temper co-existing with trust and faith. I want to create an enterprise that impacts, influences and transforms careers and lives.
- I also believe that in a country like India, the only tool of empowerment is education. Good education can make billionaires out of paupers and bad education can do the opposite. If India has to claim its demographic dividend, we need to invest in our children, our youth through education. A misguided young population can quickly turn into a nightmare. I hope that I will be that spark that keeps fighting in small bits for India to be where it deserves. Dr. Man Mohan Singh and Dr.Kalam are my heroes – from how they were best students to become great leaders.
- My ability is limited. My reach is limited. My influence is limited too. But the power of my dreams is powerful. And so, I created a platform, Careers360.com, where 400 million sessions happen every year; 60 million students and parents visit each year. 5 million students register and use our tools and products every year.
- I am not a magician. I am a believer – in goodness, impact and change. I will fall. I will fail. But I will get up.
- Because I believe in my idea and the change it can bring. If you are a believer to, feel free to join forces!

- And rote learning is not required
- AI will be question and answer with voice, and all facts will be accessible all the time

Use gemini or gpt live to learn about some topic

Create a tutoring system, that teaches naturally, and ask questions, create conversation, don't create a monologue.

Teach the best conversation techniques to gpt so it tries good conversation with the child and try to create a curiosity.

Feedback from camera from a child expression is very important, so gpt understand how child is expressing through his gestures and facial expressions. And tweak the delivery of education based on that.

Next big revolution is from text based gpt to voice, and then from voice based gpt to video, over both ways.

Audio visual communication.

### ChatGPT Feedback

- Same questions asked multiple times
- Skipped answer that I gave answered old
- Phone got hot
- Revision not effective
- Cannot remember what I answered and not answered
- 10 mins of free advanced voice model
- Learning is not that effective with only voice models, for deep learning, reading text generally offers better comprehension and retention of information compared to listening or watching. (Is it because I have learned as a kid this way or it's inherent for humans)

Vision - world's best tutor democratized

The problem is how to add human intelligence to our LLM model like if you are bad at history and that is only 10% of the whole 100% marks in UPSC then LLM should decide that it should focus more on the remaining 90% rather than the 10% which you are not able to crack.

First LLM should be trained on whole UPSC syllabus and should know everything about UPSC. It should have like 1 crore column and then for each candidate one row and it should know for each candidate what he/she knows.

This whole 1 crore features now should be sent to the LLM to decide on the next plan of action. as to what should be taught today to the candidate so that he can reach the ultimate goal. Foundational things should be taught first.

It should also get when you want to give the exam. And create a plan according to that along with probability of cracking the exam displayed each day.

It should make sure you learn 8 or whatever allocated hours for that day, based on your plan.

First judge the LLM what is its current capability for cracking UPSC exam.

### Heckman Curve

he Heckman Curve shows that the highest rate of economic returns comes from the earliest investments in children, providing an eye-opening understanding that society invests too much money in later development when it is often too late to provide great value. It shows the economic benefits of investing early and building skill upon skill to provide greater success to more children and greater productivity and reduce social spending for society.

![Heckman Curve](../../media/Screenshot%202025-06-07%20at%205.49.43%20PM.jpg)

"The family into which a child is born plays a powerful role in determining lifetime opportunities...Some kids win the **lottery at birth**, far too many don't - and most people have a hard time catching up over the rest of their lives."
