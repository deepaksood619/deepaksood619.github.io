### Thoughts

- Reading and writing is not required
- And rote learning is not required
- AI will be question and answer with voice, and all facts will be accessible all the time

Use gemini or gpt live to learn about some topic

Create a tutoring system, that teaches naturally, and ask questions, create conversation, don't create a monologue.

Teach the best conversation techniques to gpt so it tries good conversation with the child and try to create a curiosity.

Feedback from camera from a child expression is very important, so gpt understand how child is expressing through his gestures and facial expressions. And tweak the delivery of education based on that.

Next big revolution is from text based gpt to voice, and then from voice based gpt to video, over both ways.

Audio visual communication.

### ChatGPT Feedback

- Same questions asked multiple times
- Skipped answer that I gave answered old
- Phone got hot
- Revision not effective
- Cannot remember what I answered and not answered
- 10 mins of free advanced voice model
- Learning is not that effective with only voice models, for deep learning, reading text generally offers better comprehension and retention of information compared to listening or watching. (Is it because I have learned as a kid this way or it's inherent for humans)

Vision - world's best tutor democratized

The problem is how to add human intelligence to our LLM model like if you are bad at history and that is only 10% of the whole 100% marks in UPSC then LLM should decide that it should focus more on the remaining 90% rather than the 10% which you are not able to crack.

First LLM should be trained on whole UPSC syllabus and should know everything about UPSC. It should have like 1 crore column and then for each candidate one row and it should know for each candidate what he/she knows.

This whole 1 crore features now should be sent to the LLM to decide on the next plan of action. as to what should be taught today to the candidate so that he can reach the ultimate goal. Foundational things should be taught first.

It should also get when you want to give the exam. And create a plan according to that along with probability of cracking the exam displayed each day.

It should make sure you learn 8 or whatever allocated hours for that day, based on your plan.

First judge the LLM what is its current capability for cracking UPSC exam.
