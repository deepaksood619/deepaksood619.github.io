parity bitandodd parity bit.\nIn the case of even parity, for a given set of bits, the occurrences of bits whose value is 1 is counted. If that count is odd, the parity bit value is set to 1, making the total count of occurrences of 1s in the whole set (including the parity bit) an even number. If the count of 1s in a given set of bits is already even, the parity bit's value is 0.\nIn the case of odd parity, the coding is reversed. For a given set of bits, if the count of bits with a value of 1 is even, the parity bit value is set to 1 making the total count of 1s in the whole set (including the parity bit) an odd number. If the count of bits with a value of 1 is odd, the count is already odd so the parity bit's value is 0.\nEven parity is a special case of a ",(0,a.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check"},"cyclic redundancy check"),"(CRC), where the 1-bit CRC is generated by the ",(0,a.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial"},"polynomial")," x+1.\nIf a bit is present at a point otherwise dedicated to a parity bit, but is not used for parity, it may be referred to as amark parity bitif the parity bit is always 1, or aspace parity bitif the bit is always 0. In such cases where the value of the bit is constant, it may be called astick parity biteven though its function has nothing to do with parity.The function of such bits varies with the system design, but examples of functions for such bits include timing management, or identification of a packet as being of data or address significance.
