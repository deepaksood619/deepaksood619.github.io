The first part of the address is used to identify the network that the address is a part of. The part that comes afterwards is used to specify a specific host within that network.\nWhere the network specification ends and the host specification begins depends on how the network is configured. We will discuss this more thoroughly momentarily.\nIPv4 addresses were traditionally divided into five different "classes", named A through E, meant to differentiate segments of the available addressable IPv4 space. These are defined by the first four bits of each address. You can identify what class an IP address belongs to by looking at these bits.\nHere is a translation table that defines the addresses based on their leading bits:'),(0,s.kt)("ul",null,(0,s.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,s.kt)("strong",{parentName:"li"},"Class A"))),(0,s.kt)("p",null,'0---: If the first bit of an IPv4 address is "0", this means that the address is part of class A.

Any address that begins with four "1" bits is included in this class.\nClass D addresses are reserved for multi-casting protocols, which allow a packet to be sent to a group of hosts in one movement. Class E addresses are reserved for future and experimental use, and are largely not used.\nTraditionally, each of the regular classes (A-C) divided the networking and host portions of the address differently to accommodate different sized networks. Class A addresses used the remainder of the first octet to represent the network and the rest of the address to define hosts. This was good for defining a few networks with a lot of hosts each.\nThe class B addresses used the first two octets (the remainder of the first, and the entire second) to define the network and the rest to define the hosts on each network. The class C addresses used the first three octets to define the network and the last octet to define hosts within that network.\nThe division of large portions of IP space into classes is now almost a legacy concept. Originally, this was implemented as a stop-gap for the problem of rapidly depleting IPv4 addresses (you can have multiple computers with the same host if they are in separate networks). This was replaced largely by later schemes that we will discuss below.'),(0,s.kt)("h2",{id:"reserved-ip-addresses"},"Reserved IP Addresses"),(0,s.kt)("p",null,"One of the most useful reserved ranges is the loopback range specified by addresses from 127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255.
