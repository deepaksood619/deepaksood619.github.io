In DevOps, IoT, or APM it is easy to collect hundreds of millions or billions of unique data points every day.\nFor example, let's say we have 200 VMs or servers running, with each server collecting an average of 100 measurements every 10 seconds. Given there are 86,400 seconds in a day, a single measurement will generate 8,640 points in a day per server. That gives us a total of 172,800,000 (200 ",(0,s.kt)("em",{parentName:"li"},"100")," 8,640) individual data points per day. We find similar or larger numbers in sensor data use cases.\nThe volume of data means that the write throughput can be very high. We regularly get requests for setups than can handle hundreds of thousands of writes per second. Some larger companies will only consider systems that can handle millions of writes per second.\nAt the same time, time series data can be a high read throughput use case. It's true that if you're tracking 700,000 unique metrics or time series you can't hope to visualize all of them. That leads many people to think that you don't actually read most of the data that goes into the database. However, other than dashboards that people have up on their screens, there are automated systems for monitoring or combining the large volume of time series data with other types of data.\nInside InfluxDB, aggregate functions calculated on the fly may combine tens of thousands of distinct time series into a single view. Each one of those queries must read each aggregated data point, so for InfluxDB the read throughput is often many times higher than the write throughput.\nGiven that time series is mostly an append-only workload, you might think that it's possible to get great performance on a B+Tree. Appends in the keyspace are efficient and you can achieve greater than 100,000 per second. However, we have those appends happening in individual time series. So the inserts end up looking more like random inserts than append only inserts.\nOne of the biggest problems we found with time series data is that it's very common to delete all data after it gets past a certain age. The common pattern here is that users have high precision data that is kept for a short period of time like a few days or months. Users then downsample and aggregate that data into lower precision rollups that are kept around much longer.\nThe naive implementation would be to simply delete each record once it passes its expiration time. However, that means that once the first points written reach their expiration date, the system is processing just as many deletes as writes, which is something most storage engines aren't designed for.\nLet's dig into the details of the two types of storage engines we tried and how these properties had a significant impact on our performance.\n",(0,s.kt)("a",{parentName:"li",href:"https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/storage_engine/#leveldb-and-log-structured-merge-trees"},(0,s.kt)("strong",{parentName:"a"},"LevelDB and log structured merge trees")))),(0,s.kt)("p",null,'When the InfluxDB project began, we picked LevelDB as the storage engine because we had used it for time series data storage in the product that was the precursor to InfluxDB.

It exposes an API for a key-value store where the key space is sorted. This last part is important for time series data as it allowed us to quickly scan ranges of time as long as the timestamp was in the key.\nLSM Trees are based on a log that takes writes and two structures known as Mem Tables and SSTables. These tables represent the sorted keyspace. SSTables are read only files that are continuously replaced by other SSTables that merge inserts and updates into the keyspace."),(0,s.kt)("p",null,"The two biggest advantages that LevelDB had for us were high write throughput and built in compression. However, as we learned more about what people needed with time series data, we encountered a few insurmountable challenges.\nThe first problem we had was that LevelDB doesn't support hot backups. If you want to do a safe backup of the database, you have to close it and then copy it. The LevelDB variants RocksDB and HyperLevelDB fix this problem, but there was another more pressing problem that we didn't think they could solve.\nOur users needed a way to automatically manage data retention. That meant we needed deletes on a very large scale. In LSM Trees, a delete is as expensive, if not more so, than a write. A delete writes a new record known as a tombstone. After that queries merge the result set with any tombstones to purge the deleted data from the query return. Later, a compaction runs that removes the tombstone record and the underlying deleted record in the SSTable file.\nTo get around doing deletes, we split data across what we call shards, which are contiguous blocks of time. Shards would typically hold either one day or seven days worth of data. Each shard mapped to an underlying LevelDB. This meant that we could drop an entire day of data by just closing out the database and removing the underlying files.\nUsers of RocksDB may at this point bring up a feature called ColumnFamilies. When putting time series data into Rocks, it's common to split blocks of time into column families and then drop those when their time is up. It's the same general idea: create a separate area where you can just drop files instead of updating indexes when you delete a large block of data. Dropping a column family is a very efficient operation. However, column families are a fairly new feature and we had another use case for shards.\nOrganizing data into shards meant that it could be moved within a cluster without having to examine billions of keys. At the time of this writing, it was not possible to move a column family in one RocksDB to another. Old shards are typically cold for writes so moving them around would be cheap and easy. We would have the added benefit of having a spot in the keyspace that is cold for writes so it would be easier to do consistency checks later.\nThe organization of data into shards worked great for a while, until a large amount of data went into InfluxDB. LevelDB splits the data out over many small files. Having dozens or hundreds of these databases open in a single process ended up creating a big problem. Users that had six months or a year of data would run out of file handles. It's not something we found with the majority of users, but anyone pushing the database to its limits would hit this problem and we had no fix for it. There were simply too many file handles open.\n",(0,s.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/storage_engine/#boltdb-and-mmap-b-trees"},(0,s.kt)("strong",{parentName:"a"},"BoltDB and mmap B+Trees"))),(0,s.kt)("p",null,"After struggling with LevelDB and its variants for a year we decided to move over to BoltDB, a pure Golang database heavily inspired by LMDB, a mmap B+Tree database written in C. It has the same API semantics as LevelDB: a key value store where the keyspace is ordered. Many of our users were surprised. Our own posted tests of the LevelDB variants vs. LMDB (a mmap B+Tree) showed RocksDB as the best performer.\nHowever, there were other considerations that went into this decision outside of the pure write performance. At this point our most important goal was to get to something stable that could be run in production and backed up. BoltDB also had the advantage of being written in pure Go, which simplified our build chain immensely and made it easy to build for other OSes and platforms.\nThe biggest win for us was that BoltDB used a single file as the database. At this point our most common source of bug reports were from people running out of file handles. Bolt solved the hot backup problem and the file limit problems all at the same time.\nWe were willing to take a hit on write throughput if it meant that we'd have a system that was more reliable and stable that we could build on. Our reasoning was that for anyone pushing really big write loads, they'd be running a cluster anyway.\nWe released versions 0.9.0 to 0.9.2 based on BoltDB. From a development perspective it was delightful. Clean API, fast and easy to build in our Go project, and reliable. However, after running for a while we found a big problem with write throughput. After the database got over a few GB, writes would start spiking IOPS.\nSome users were able to get past this by putting InfluxDB on big hardware with near unlimited IOPS. However, most users are on VMs with limited resources in the cloud. We had to figure out a way to reduce the impact of writing a bunch of points into hundreds of thousands of series at a time.\nWith the 0.9.3 and 0.9.4 releases our plan was to put a write ahead log (WAL) in front of Bolt. That way we could reduce the number of random insertions into the keyspace. Instead, we'd buffer up multiple writes that were next to each other and then flush them at once. However, that only served to delay the problem. High IOPS still became an issue and it showed up very quickly for anyone operating at even moderate work loads.\nHowever, our experience building the first WAL implementation in front of Bolt gave us the confidence we needed that the write problem could be solved. The performance of the WAL itself was fantastic, the index simply could not keep up. At this point we started thinking again about how we could create something similar to an LSM Tree that could keep up with our write load.\nThus was born the ",(0,s.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Time Structured Merge Tree."),"\n",(0,s.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/storage_engine/#the-new-influxdb-storage-engine-and-lsm-refined"},"https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/storage_engine/#the-new-influxdb-storage-engine-and-lsm-refined")))}p.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
