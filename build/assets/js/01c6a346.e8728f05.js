Both hardware and software implementations of LFSRs are common.\nThe mathematics of a ",(0,i.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check"},"cyclic redundancy check"),", used to provide a quick check against transmission errors, are closely related to those of an LFSR.In general, the arithmetics behind LFSRs makes them very elegant as an object to study and implement. One can produce relatively complex logics with simple building blocks. However, other methods, that are less elegant but perform better, should be considered as well.\n",(0,i.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register"},"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register")))}u.isMDXComponent=!0},988423:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>a});const a=n.p+"assets/images/Others-image2-general-d56ef17ca8058e1e26e01be1ee7abcab.jpg"},8538:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>a});const a=n.p+"assets/images/ds-Others-image1-75390b82abc2dc5a799b5f23189a1bb0.jpg"}}]);
