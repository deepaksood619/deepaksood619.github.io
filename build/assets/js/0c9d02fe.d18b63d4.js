But then of course does not follow the principle that says that restful APIs should be stateless and that's why solutions like JWT became popular and effective.\nAlthough JWTs can be encrypted to also provide secrecy between parties, we will focus onsignedtokens.

This means user manipulation of the JWT token is futile because the server will know and disregard the token. The server adds a signature based on the payload when issuing a token to the client.

Cookies often contain unencrypted payloads. If you are using HTTPS then everything is good. If you aren't then it's advisable to encrypt sensitive cookies themselves. Not doing so will mean that a man-in-the-middle attack is possible--a proxy server or ISP reads the cookies and then replays them later on pretending to be you.

Only then we have a really secure system.\nThe signing algorithm takes the header, the payload, and the secret to create a unique signature.
