As such, the library is extremely simple because it requires no page caching layer of its own, and it is extremely high performance and memory-efficient.

LMDB tracks free pages within the database and re-uses them for new write operations, so the database size does not grow without bound in normal use.\nThe memory map can be used as a read-only or read-write map.
