Each hop's throughput is governed by that hop's RTT and is individually higher than the direct throughput between A and B.\nBut performance issues can arise due to the interaction among path segments and different layers for any particular solution. For example, in TCP Splitting, the intermediate node (the spoofer) sends back a spoofing ACK packet to the TCP sender immediately upon receiving a TCP data packet instead of waiting for the ACK from the final TCP destination.\nOne of the well known problems of TCP splitting is that by breaking the end-to-end connection, a split TCP connection is no longer reliable or secure, and a server failure may cause the client to believe that data has been successfully received when it has not.
