QUIC streams share the same QUIC connection, so no additional handshakes and slow starts are required to create new ones, but QUIC streams are delivered independently such that in most cases packet loss affecting one stream doesn't affect others. This is possible because QUIC packets are encapsulated on top of UDP datagrams.\nUsing UDP allows much more flexibility compared to TCP, and enables QUIC implementations to live fully in user-space - updates to the protocol's implementations are not tied to operating systems updates as is the case with TCP. With QUIC, HTTP-level streams can be simply mapped on top of QUIC streams to get all the benefits of HTTP/2 without the head-of-line blocking.\nQUIC also combines the typical 3-way TCP handshake with ",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://blog.cloudflare.com/rfc-8446-aka-tls-1-3/"},"TLS 1.3"),"'s handshake.

QUIC enforces delivery order of bytes within single streams, but does not guarantee ordering among different streams.\nThis behavior required the creation of a new HTTP header compression scheme, called QPACK, which fixes the problem but requires changes to the HTTP mapping. In addition, some of the features offered by HTTP/2 (like per-stream flow control) are already offered by QUIC itself, so they were dropped from HTTP/3 in order to remove unnecessary complexity from the protocol.\nQUIC Features"),(0,o.kt)("ul",null,(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"All QUIC connections are fully encrypted.
