For example, in a connection between 10.20.30.40:4444 and 50.60.70.80:8888 (local IP address:local port, foreign IP address:foreign port), there will also be an associated socket at each end, corresponding to the internal representation of the connection by the protocol stack on that node. These are referred to locally by numerical socket descriptors, say 317 at one side and 922 at the other. A process on node 10.20.30.40 can request to communicate with node 50.60.70.80 on port 8888 (request that the protocol stack create a socket to communicate with that destination), and once it has created a socket and received a socket descriptor (317), it can communicate via this socket by using the descriptor (317). The protocol stack will then forward data to and from node 50.60.70.80 on port 8888. However, a process on node 10.20.30.40 cannot request to communicate based on the foreign socket descriptor, (e.g. "socket 922" or "socket 922 on node 50.60.70.80") as these are internal to the foreign node and are not usable by the protocol stack on node 10.20.30.40.\n',(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket"},"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket")),(0,o.kt)("h2",{id:"ports"},"Ports"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"In ",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_networking"},"computer networking"),", aportis a communication endpoint.
