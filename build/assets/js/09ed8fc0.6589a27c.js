The following is just as much as you'll need to know in order to have a working understanding of what certain snippets of Spark code do. In Spark, when an item of processing has to be done, there is a \"driver\" process that is in charge of taking the user's code and converting it into a set of multiple tasks. There are also \"executor\" processes, each operating on a separate node in the cluster, that are in charge of running the tasks, as delegated by the driver. Each driver process has a set of executors that it has access to in order to run tasks. A Spark **application** is a user built program that consists of a driver and that driver's associated executors. A Spark**jobis task or set of tasks to be executed with executor processes, as directed by the driver. A job is triggered by the calling of an RDD Action.
