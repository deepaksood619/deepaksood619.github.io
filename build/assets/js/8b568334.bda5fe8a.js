Clients query the lookaside LB and the LB responds with best server(s) to use. The heavy lifting of keeping server state and implementation of LB algorithm is consolidated in the lookaside LB. Note that client might choose to implement simple algorithms on top of the sophisticated ones implemented in the LB. gRPC defines a protocol for communication between client and LB using this model.
