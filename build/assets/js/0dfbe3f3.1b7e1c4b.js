Another advantage is that both reads and writes are atomic: The kernel prevents other processes from performing IO on the same descriptor during read and write operations, guaranteeing data integrity.\nFrom the development perspective, if data is laid out in a certain way in the file (say, it's split out into a fixed-size header and multiple fixed size blocks), it is possible to issue a single call that will fill up separate buffers allocated for these parts.\nThis sounds rather useful but, somehow, just a few databases use the Vectored IO. This might be because general purpose databases work with a bunch of files simultaneously, trying to guarantee liveness for each running operation and reduce their latencies, so and data is accessed and cached block-wise.
