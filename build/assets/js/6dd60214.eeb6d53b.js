However, as traffic (i.e. concurrency) increases, a bottleneck is created.\nOverall, Lock Contention problems have a relatively low impact. They manifest themselves by impacting and limiting scalability. As concurrency increases, system throughput does not increase and may even degrade (as shown in Figure 1 below).
