Once the subarrays reach trivial length, merging begins. Merging takes the smallest element between two adjacent subarrays and repeats that step until all elements are taken, resulting in a sorted subarray. The process is repeated on pairs of adjacent subarrays until we arrive at the starting array, but sorted.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"algorithms/searching-sorting/msd-radix-sort":{"id":"algorithms/searching-sorting/msd-radix-sort","title":"MSD Radix Sort","description":"image","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"algorithms/searching-sorting/others":{"id":"algorithms/searching-sorting/others","title":"Others","description":"Beating sorting lower bounds","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"algorithms/searching-sorting/quick-sort":{"id":"algorithms/searching-sorting/quick-sort","title":"Quick Sort","description":"Quicksortis performed by taking the first (leftmost) element of the array as a pivot point. We then compare it to each following element. When we find one that is smaller, we move it to the left. The moving is performed quickly by swapping that element with the first element after the pivot point, and then swapping the pivot point with the element after it. After going through the whole array, we take all points on the left of the pivot and call quicksort on that subarray, and we do the same to all points on the right of the pivot. The recursion is performed until we reach subarrays of 0-1 elements in length.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"algorithms/searching-sorting/readme":{"id":"algorithms/searching-sorting/readme","title":"Searching Sorting","description":"- Intro","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"algorithms/searching-sorting/selection-sort":{"id":"algorithms/searching-sorting/selection-sort","title":"Selection Sort","description":"Not stable","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"algorithms/searching-sorting/shell-sort":{"id":"algorithms/searching-sorting/shell-sort","title":"Shell Sort","description":"- In-place comparison sort","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"algorithms/searching-sorting/shuffle-sort":{"id":"algorithms/searching-sorting/shuffle-sort","title":"Shuffle Sort","description":"Goal: Rearrange array so that result is a uniformly random permutation","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"algorithms/searching-sorting/system-sort":{"id":"algorithms/searching-sorting/system-sort","title":"System Sort","description":"Java System Sort - Arrays.sort()","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"algorithms/searching-sorting/timsort":{"id":"algorithms/searching-sorting/timsort","title":"TimSort","description":"- Hybrid algorithm which uses binary insertion sort and improved merge sort by using galloping in a combination.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"algorithms/string-algorithms/boyer-moore":{"id":"algorithms/string-algorithms/boyer-moore","title":"Boyer-Moore","description":"image","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"algorithms/string-algorithms/brute-force":{"id":"algorithms/string-algorithms/brute-force","title":"Brute Force","description":"image","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"algorithms/string-algorithms/intro":{"id":"algorithms/string-algorithms/intro","title":"Intro","description":"Subarray/substring","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"algorithms/string-algorithms/knuth-morris-pratt":{"id":"algorithms/string-algorithms/knuth-morris-pratt","title":"Knuth-Morris-Pratt","description":"image","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"algorithms/string-algorithms/longest-common-prefix":{"id":"algorithms/string-algorithms/longest-common-prefix","title":"Longest Common Prefix","description":"image","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"algorithms/string-algorithms/rabin-karp":{"id":"algorithms/string-algorithms/rabin-karp","title":"Rabin Karp","description":"image","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"algorithms/string-algorithms/readme":{"id":"algorithms/string-algorithms/readme","title":"String Algorithms","description":"- Intro","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"algorithms/string-algorithms/substring-search-intro":{"id":"algorithms/string-algorithms/substring-search-intro","title":"Substring Search Intro","description":"Substring Search.In this lecture we consider algorithms for searching for a substring in a piece of text.

Then, we introduce the Boyer--Moore algorithm, whose running time is sublinear on typical inputs.

The capacitor can either be charged or discharged; these two states are taken to represent the two values of a bit, conventionally called 0 and 1. The electric charge on the capacitors slowly leaks off, so without intervention the data on the chip would soon be lost. To prevent this, DRAM requires an external memory refresh circuit which periodically rewrites the data in the capacitors, restoring them to their original charge. This refresh process is the defining characteristic of dynamic random-access memory, in contrast to static random-access memory(SRAM) which does not require data to be refreshed. Unlike flash memory, DRAM is volatile memory(vs.non-volatile memory), since it loses its data quickly when power is removed. However, DRAM does exhibit limited data remanence.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"computer-science/operating-system/intro":{"id":"computer-science/operating-system/intro","title":"Intro","description":"There are three key elements of an operating system","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"computer-science/operating-system/journaling-file-system":{"id":"computer-science/operating-system/journaling-file-system","title":"Journaling File System","description":"Ajournaling file systemis a file system that keeps track of changes not yet committed to the file system\'s main part by recording the intentions of such changes in a data structure known as a \\"journal)\\", which is usually a circular log.
