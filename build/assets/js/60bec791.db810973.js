This single HTB class will be set with two parameters, a rate and a ceil. These values should be the same for the top-level class, and will represent the total available bandwidth on the link.\nIn HTB, rate means the guaranteed bandwidth available for a given class and ceil is short for ceiling, which indicates the maximum bandwidth that class is allowed to consume. Any bandwidth used between rate and ceil is borrowed from a parent class, hence the suggestion that rate and ceil be the same in the top-level class.\nHierarchical Token Bucket implements a classful queuing mechanism for the linux traffic control system, and provides rate and ceil to allow the user to control the absolute bandwidth to particular classes of traffic as well as indicate the ratio of distribution of bandwidth when extra bandwidth become available(up to ceil).\n",(0,a.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket"},"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket")),(0,a.kt)("h2",{id:"leaky-bucket"},"Leaky Bucket"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket"},"Leaky bucket"),"(closely related to ",(0,a.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket"},"token bucket"),") is an algorithm that provides a simple, intuitive approach to rate limiting via a queue which you can think of as a bucket holding the requests.
