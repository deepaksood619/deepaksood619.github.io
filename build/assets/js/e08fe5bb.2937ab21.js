After eight years of open source development, Elasticsearch is excellent at core search functionalities, such as indexing data, sharding, and serving queries.\nWith improved access to machine learning tools, search applications can advance in new and interesting ways. For example, an incoming search query can be sent to an API for natural language processing before being served by the search engine. A natural language processing API can derive additional meaning from the query, adding metadata to a search query. Machine learning can also be applied to better understand how people are searching across your search index, and to optimize the search index to incorporate those user preferences.\nLiam Cavanagh is the principal program manager on Azure Search.
