Besides adding or removing elements from the set, we need fast functions to compute the intersection, the union, the difference between sets, and so on."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"To implement a set of integers, a particularly appealing strategy is the bitmap (also called bitset or bit vector). Using n bits, we can represent any set made of the integers from the range [0, n): the ith bit is set to one if integer i is present in the set. Commodity processors use words of W=32 or W=64 bits.
