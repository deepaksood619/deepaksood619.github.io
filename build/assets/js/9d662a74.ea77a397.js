TheWord Aligned Hybrid(WAH) bitmap compression trades some space to allow for bitwise operations without first decompressing bitmaps. WAH has been recognized as the most efficient scheme in terms of computation time. In this paper we present CONCISE(Compressed 'n' ComposableIntegerSet), a new scheme that enjoys significatively better performances than those of WAH. In particular, when compared to WAH, our algorithm is able to reduce the required memory up to 50%, by having similar or better performance in terms of computation time. Further, we show that CONCISE can be efficiently used to manipulate bitmaps representing sets of integral numbers in lieu of well-known data structures such as arrays, lists, hashtables, and self-balancing binary search trees.

In this paper we in-troduced a new compression scheme for bitmaps, referred to as CONCISE, that is a good trade-offbetween the speed of uncom-pressed bitmaps and the required memory. Indeed, CONCISE outperformed all analyzed data structures in terms of memory occupation, as well as WAH, the best known compression algo-rithm that allows for set operations directly on the compressedform. As for computation time, CONCISEalso outperformedclassical data structures for set operations.However, accessing individual elements can be expensivefor both CONCISE and WAH.

Many bitmap compression techniques have been proposed, almost all relying primarily on run-length encoding (RLE). However, on unsorted data, we can get superior performance with a hybrid compression technique that uses both uncompressed bitmaps and packed arrays inside a two-level tree. An instance of this technique, Roaring, has recently been proposed.Due to its good performance, it has been adopted by several production platforms (e.g., Apache Lucene, Apache Spark, Apache Kylin and Druid).Yet there are cases where run-length encoded bitmaps are smaller than the original Roaring bitmaps - typically when the data is sorted so that the bitmaps containlong compressible runs. To better handlethese cases, we build a new Roaring hybrid that combines uncompressed bitmaps, packed arrays and RLEcompressed segments. The result is a new Roaring format thatcompresses better.Overall, our new implementation of Roaring can be several times faster (up to two orders of magnitude)than the implementations of traditional RLE-based alternatives (WAH, Concise, EWAH) while compressing better.
