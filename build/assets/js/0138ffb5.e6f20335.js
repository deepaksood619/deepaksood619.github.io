It doesn't mean I won't ramp up the next day to 10,000 or a 100,000, but I really try to start off small to try to figure out what works. Now, if I'm paying for services or hiring an agency, it's a little bit different because someone's creating a plan for me, and then executing on it.

Everyone's like, \"Oh, I'm going to release a new website.\" We don't do that. We just continually A/B test our websites until we come up with a perfect variation.
