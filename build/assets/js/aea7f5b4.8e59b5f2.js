However, in this case, we passed*because we want the server to generate a new ID for us. Every new ID will be monotonically increasing, so in more simple terms, every new entry added will have a higher ID compared to all the past entries. Auto-generation of IDs by the server is almost always what you want, and the reasons for specifying an ID explicitly are very rare. We'll talk more about this later. The fact that each Stream entry has an ID is another similarity with log files, where line numbers, or the byte offset inside the file, can be used in order to identify a given entry.

Since the sequence number is 64 bit wide, in practical terms there are no limits in the number of entries that can be generated within the same millisecond.\nThe format of such IDs may look strange at first, and the gentle reader may wonder why the time is part of the ID. The reason is that Redis streams support range queries by ID. Because the ID is related to the time the entry is generated, this gives the ability to query for ranges of time basically for free. We will see this soon while covering theXRANGEcommand.\nIf for some reason the user needs incremental IDs that are not related to time but are actually associated to another external system ID, as previously already observed, theXADDcommand can take an explicit ID instead of the*wildcard ID that triggers auto-generation, like in the following examples:"),(0,n.kt)("pre",null,(0,n.kt)("code",{parentName:"pre",className:"language-bash"},"> XADD somestream 0-1 field value\n0-1\n> XADD somestream 0-2 foo bar\n0-2\nNote that in this case, the minimum ID is 0-1 and that the command will not accept an ID equal or smaller than a previous one:\n\n> XADD somestream 0-1 foo bar\n(error) ERR The ID specified in XADD is equal or smaller than the target stream top item\n")),(0,n.kt)("h2",{id:"getting-data-from-streams"},"Getting data from Streams"),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Now we are finally able to append entries in our stream viaXADD.
