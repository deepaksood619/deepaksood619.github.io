Given the normalization of both the cumulative population and the cumulative share of income used to calculate the Gini coefficient, the measure is not overly sensitive to the specifics of the income distribution, but rather only on how incomes vary relative to the other members of a population. The exception to this is in the ",(0,a.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redistribution_of_income"},"redistribution of income")," resulting in a minimum income for all people. When the population is sorted, if their income distribution were to approximate a well-known function, then some representative values could be calculated.\nThe Gini coefficient was proposed by Gini as a measure of ",(0,a.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_inequality"},"inequality")," of ",(0,a.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_metrics"},"income")," or ",(0,a.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_concentration"},"wealth"),".For ",(0,a.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development"},"OECD countries"),", in the late 20th century, considering the effect of taxes and ",(0,a.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_payments"},"transfer payments"),", the income Gini coefficient ranged between 0.24 and 0.49, with Slovenia being the lowest and Mexico the highest.African countries had the highest pre-tax Gini coefficients in 2008--2009, with South Africa the world's highest, variously estimated to be 0.63 to 0.7, although this figure drops to 0.52 after social assistance is taken into account, and drops again to 0.47 after taxation.The global income Gini coefficient in 2005 has been estimated to be between 0.61 and 0.68 by various sources.\nThere are some issues in interpreting a Gini coefficient. The same value may result from many different distribution curves. The demographic structure should be taken into account. Countries with an aging population, or with a baby boom, experience an increasing pre-tax Gini coefficient even if real income distribution for working adults remains constant. Scholars have devised over a dozen variants of the Gini coefficient.\n",(0,a.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient"},"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient")),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gini-index.asp"},"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gini-index.asp")),(0,a.kt)("h2",{id:"lorenz-curve"},"Lorenz Curve"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"The Lorenz curve is a graphical representation of ",(0,a.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income-inequality.asp"},"income inequality")," or wealth inequality developed by American economistMax Lorenz in 1905.
