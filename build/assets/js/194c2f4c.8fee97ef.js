In the past, this was trivial to implement, since all operations within the transactional scope were executed against a single RDBMS that provided row-locking, deadlock-detection, and roll-back features. Once data became distributed across multiple databases, the Two-Phase Commit protocol (2PC) became a standard for distributed transactions. However, while both approaches worked, they were not designed witheventual consistencyin mind.\nIf we presume a dependency will be unavailable during a distributed transaction, then we should also presume frequent rollbacks will cause sporadic unavailability across the system - which is neither cloud native nor improves time-to-market.\nThis can be solved by relaxing strict requirements for ACID guarantees, which have propped up relational databases across most traditional architectures for decades. While relational databases have their place within microservice architectures, their relevance becomes much more situational.
