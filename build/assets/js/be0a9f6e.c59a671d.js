Polymorphism is the phenomenon wherein somewhat interchangeable objects each expose an operation of the same name but possibly differing in behavior. As an example, aFileobject and aDatabaseobject both have aStoreRecordmethod that can be used to write a personnel record to storage. Their implementations differ. A program holds a reference to an object which may be either aFileobject or aDatabaseobject. Which it is may have been determined by a run-time setting, and at this stage, the program may not know or care which. When the program callsStoreRecordon the object, something needs to choose which behavior gets enacted. If one thinks of OOP as ",(0,n.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing"},"sending messages")," to objects, then in this example the program sends aStoreRecordmessage to an object of unknown type, leaving it to the run-time support system to dispatch the message to the right object.
