In LOOK scheduling, the arm goes only as far as final requests in each direction and then reverses direction without going all the way to the end.

This actually takes advantage of the fact that many drives can move the read/write head at high speeds if it's moving across a large number of tracks (e.g. the seek time from the last track to track 0 is smaller than one would expect and usually considerably less than the time it would take to seek there one track at a time).The huge jump from one end request to the other is not considered as a head movement as the cylinders are treated as a circular list."),(0,a.kt)("h3",{id:"n-look-and-f-look"},"N-LOOK and F-LOOK"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"N and F LOOK were designed to offset LOOK's bias towards recent jobs.

To explain these algorithms we're going to use the example of a disk with 200 tracks, and the read/write head starts at track 100. The request queue, in order, contains requests for tracks: 55, 58, 18, 90, 160, 38, we assume that the request queue is split into two, with the oldest one containing the requests for tracks: 55, 58, 18, 90.
