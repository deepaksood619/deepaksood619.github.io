Upon receiving a message, consumers ack back to the server, and the server tracks the in-flight messages for each consumer. If that number goes above a certain threshold, the server will stop delivery until more acks are received. There is a similar flow-control mechanism between the publisher and the server. The trade-off here is the server needs to do some bookkeeping, which we'll get to in a bit. With a pull-based system, flow control is implicit. Consumers simply go at their own pace, and the server doesn't need to track anything. There is much less complexity with this."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Pull-based systems lend themselves to aggressive batching. With push, we must decide whether to send a message immediately or wait to accumulate more messages before sending. This is a decision pertaining to latency versus throughput. Push is often viewed as an optimization for latency, but if we're tuning for low latency, we send messages one at a time only for them to end up being buffered on the consumer anyway. With pull, the consumer fetches all available messages after its current position in the log, which basically removes the guesswork around tuning batching and latency."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,'There are API implications with this decision too, particularly from an ergonomics and complexity perspective. Kafka clients tend to be "thick" and have a lot of complexity. That is, they do a lot because the broker is designed to be simple. That\'s my guess as to why there are so few native client libraries up to par with the Java client. NATS Streaming clients, on the other hand, are relatively "thin" because the server does more.
