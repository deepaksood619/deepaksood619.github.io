It then calculates results over and over, each time using a different set of random values from the probability functions. Depending upon the number of uncertainties and the ranges specified for them, a Monte Carlo simulation could involve thousands or tens of thousands of recalculations before it is complete. Monte Carlo simulation produces distributions of possible outcome values.\nBy using probability distributions, variables can have different probabilities of different outcomes occurring. Probability distributions are a much more realistic way of describing uncertainty in variables of a risk analysis.\nCommon probability distributions include:"),(0,n.kt)("ul",null,(0,n.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,n.kt)("strong",{parentName:"li"},"Normal (Bell curve)"),"\nThe user simply defines the mean or expected value and a standard deviation to describe the variation about the mean.

An example might be the results of a lawsuit: 20% chance of positive verdict, 30% change of negative verdict, 40% chance of settlement, and 10% chance of mistrial.\nDuring a Monte Carlo simulation, values are sampled at random from the input probability distributions. Each set of samples is called an iteration, and the resulting outcome from that sample is recorded. Monte Carlo simulation does this hundreds or thousands of times, and the result is a probability distribution of possible outcomes. In this way, Monte Carlo simulation provides a much more comprehensive view of what may happen. It tells you not only what could happen, but how likely it is to happen.\nMonte Carlo simulation provides a number of advantages over deterministic, or "single-point estimate" analysis:'),(0,n.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,n.kt)("strong",{parentName:"li"},"Probabilistic Results:")," Results show not only what could happen, but how likely each outcome is."),(0,n.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,n.kt)("strong",{parentName:"li"},"Graphical Results:")," Because of the data a Monte Carlo simulation generates, it's easy to create graphs of different outcomes and their chances of occurrence.
