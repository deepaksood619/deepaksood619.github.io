They are extensively used for exchanging messages since they provide an abstraction of the different participating system entities, alleviating their coordination and simplifying the communication programming details.\nThe basic idea of MOM is that communication takes place by adding messages to distributed queues, and by getting messages from those queues. Based on the model of Message Oriented Middleware, many protocols have been developed, e.g. DDS, STOMP, XMPP. The two most widely used proposals are: the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT).\nSee also:"),(0,n.kt)("ul",null,(0,n.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"AMQP"),(0,n.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"MQTT"),(0,n.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"ZeroMQ: Distributed Messaging")),(0,n.kt)("h2",{id:"rabbitmq-the-polyglot-broker-distributed-message-broker"},"RabbitMQ: The Polyglot Broker (Distributed Message Broker)"),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"All three protocols are supported by RabbitMQ broker, making it an ideal choice for interoperability between applications.\n",(0,n.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cie5v59mrTg&ab_channel=HusseinNasser"},"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cie5v59mrTg&ab_channel=HusseinNasser")),(0,n.kt)("p",null,(0,n.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzqjtU2x6YA&ab_channel=ThatDevOpsGuy"},"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzqjtU2x6YA&ab_channel=ThatDevOpsGuy")),(0,n.kt)("p",null,(0,n.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxQrpLfX3rs&ab_channel=GOTOConferences"},"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxQrpLfX3rs&ab_channel=GOTOConferences")),(0,n.kt)("p",null,(0,n.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNbdgWe5Tbs&ab_channel=GOTOConferences"},"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNbdgWe5Tbs&ab_channel=GOTOConferences")),(0,n.kt)("h2",{id:"pika"},"pika"),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Pika is a RabbitMQ (AMQP 0-9-1) client library for Python.\n",(0,n.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://pypi.org/project/pika"},"https://pypi.org/project/pika")),(0,n.kt)("p",null,(0,n.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://pika.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html"},"https://pika.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html")))}p.isMDXComponent=!0},387795:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{Z:()=>r});const r=a.p+"assets/images/Event-driven-architecture-image1-bd1f105636805325833e1f7f19210036.jpg"},734040:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{Z:()=>r});const r=a.p+"assets/images/Event-driven-architecture-image2-9fed4c79d5627302e02caf629b77ec98.jpg"},911766:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{Z:()=>r});const r=a.p+"assets/images/Event-driven-architecture-image3-95649d0db154d631fe2256525c8c432b.jpg"},622079:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{Z:()=>r});const r=a.p+"assets/images/Event-driven-architecture-image4-af813ad925924432a7e7c3bda55c8a20.jpg"},130736:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{Z:()=>r});const r=a.p+"assets/images/Event-driven-architecture-image5-5cb26935fcef9f10045e24da6ea6b7f6.jpg"},764040:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{Z:()=>r});const r=a.p+"assets/images/Event-driven-architecture-image6-59c72486db175ec6541871feffaec7a7.jpg"},328228:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{Z:()=>r});const r=a.p+"assets/images/Event-driven-architecture-image7-1bc2b3b75286975f0cd9df96616e8e6e.jpg"},357176:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{Z:()=>r});const r=a.p+"assets/images/Event-driven-architecture-image8-c54bcce621efd929e79e9f45fec76ae5.jpg"}}]);
