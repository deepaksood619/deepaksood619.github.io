After we read Arthur Brooks' book 'From Strength to Strength' (thanks to a gift from a client who has also become a friend), we understood why those of us over 40 contribute the majority of the pieces to Three Longs and Three Shorts. As Brooks explains in this tightly written book, for people like us in the Finance profession, the raw intellectual horsepower or our brain (which is called 'fluid intelligence') starts waning from the age of 40. Thankfully, however, a different type of intelligence starts improving from that age, namely, 'crystallised intelligence' i.e. the ability to absorb lots of different bits of information and influences and join the dots. Brooks uses this framework to give professionals in their 40s and 50s a framework for the second half of their careers."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,'As Jonathan Knee says in his review of this book:"According to From Strength to Strength...the basic problem is the inevitable decline in our abilities. The decline in peak performance begins far earlier than we are likely to admit across professions, not just in athletes.

"The buzz from success is neutralized quickly, leaving a hangover feeling.... after a while, you need constant success hits just not to feel like a failure...the carrot is gradually getting further away, despite the fact that you are running faster than ever.
