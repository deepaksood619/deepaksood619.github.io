And a global C statement like const char* string = "hello world" makes the string literal "hello world" to be stored in initialized read-only area and the character pointer variable string in initialized read-write area.\nEx: static int i = 10 will be stored in data segment and global int i = 10 will also be stored in data segment\n3.

(With modern large address spaces and virtual memory techniques they may be placed almost anywhere, but they still typically grow opposite directions.)\nThe stack area contains the program stack, a LIFO structure, typically located in the higher parts of memory. On the standard PC x86 computer architecture it grows toward address zero; on some other architectures it grows the opposite direction. A "stack pointer" register tracks the top of the stack; it is adjusted each time a value is "pushed" onto the stack. The set of values pushed for one function call is termed a "stack frame"; A stack frame consists at minimum of a return address.\nStack, where automatic variables are stored, along with information that is saved each time a function is called. Each time a function is called, the address of where to return to and certain information about the caller\'s environment, such as some of the machine registers, are saved on the stack. The newly called function then allocates room on the stack for its automatic and temporary variables. This is how recursive functions in C can work. Each time a recursive function calls itself, a new stack frame is used, so one set of variables doesn\'t interfere with the variables from another instance of the function.\n5.
