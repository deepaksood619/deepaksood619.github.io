Previously, each data provider would make their data available in their own specific way, providing a library of access functions. This made it difficult to obtain data from multiple sources, requiring a different access method for each, and thus dividing the total available data into partitions. GridFTP provides a uniform way of accessing the data, encompassing functions from all the different modes of access, building on and extending the universally accepted FTP standard. FTP was chosen as a basis for it because of its widespread use, and because it has a well defined architecture for extensions to the protocol (which may be dynamically discovered).\nGlobus Toolkit - GSIFTP"),(0,r.kt)("p",null,(0,r.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GridFTP"},"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GridFTP")),(0,r.kt)("h2",{id:"real-time-analytics"},"Real-Time Analytics"),(0,r.kt)("ol",null,(0,r.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},(0,r.kt)("p",{parentName:"li"},"Ingestion")),(0,r.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},(0,r.kt)("p",{parentName:"li"},"Store")),(0,r.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},(0,r.kt)("p",{parentName:"li"},"Visualize")),(0,r.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},(0,r.kt)("p",{parentName:"li"},"Act")),(0,r.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},(0,r.kt)("p",{parentName:"li"},"Predict"))),(0,r.kt)("h2",{id:"alt-aggregator-leaf-tailer---real-time-analytics-without-pipelines"},"ALT (Aggregator Leaf Tailer) - Real-Time Analytics Without Pipelines"),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Aggregator Leaf Tailer (ALT)is the data architecture favored by web-scale companies, like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google, for its efficiency and scalability.\nThe ALT architecture addresses these shortcomings of Lambda architectures.
